    61	A SHIFTING REEF
    62	
    63	The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and
    64	puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.  Not to
    65	mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the
    66	public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were
    67	particularly excited.  Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,
    68	skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,
    69	and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were
    70	deeply interested in the matter.
    71	
    72	For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing," a long
    73	object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely
    74	larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
    75	
    76	The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)
    77	agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in
    78	question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power
    79	of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed.  If
    80	it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in
    81	science.  Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at
    82	divers times--rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to
    83	this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated
    84	opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length--we
    85	might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
    86	dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at
    87	all.  And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that
    88	tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we
    89	can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
    90	supernatural apparition.  As to classing it in the list of fables, the
    91	idea was out of the question.
    92	
    93	On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the
    94	Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass
    95	five miles off the east coast of Australia.  Captain Baker thought at
    96	first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even
    97	prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water,
    98	projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred
    99	and fifty feet up into the air.  Now, unless the sandbank had been
   100	submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor
   101	Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,
   102	unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water
   103	mixed with air and vapour.
   104	
   105	Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in
   106	the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam
   107	Navigation Company.  But this extraordinary creature could transport
   108	itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an
   109	interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had
   110	observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a
   111	distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.
   112	
   113	Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the Helvetia, of
   114	the Compagnie-Nationale, and the Shannon, of the Royal Mail Steamship
   115	Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying
   116	between the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the
   117	monster to each other in 42° 15' N. lat. and 60° 35' W. long.
   118	In these simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in
   119	estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred
   120	and fifty feet, as the Shannon and Helvetia were of smaller dimensions
   121	than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.
   122	
   123	Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea
   124	round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never
   125	exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.
   126	
   127	In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion.  They sang
   128	of it in the cafes, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on
   129	the stage.  All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it.  There
   130	appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary
   131	creature, from the white whale, the terrible "Moby Dick" of sub-arctic
   132	regions, to the immense kraken, whose tentacles could entangle a ship
   133	of five hundred tons and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean.  The
   134	legends of ancient times were even revived.
   135	
   136	Then burst forth the unending argument between the believers and the
   137	unbelievers in the societies of the wise and the scientific journals.
   138	"The question of the monster" inflamed all minds.  Editors of
   139	scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,
   140	spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing
   141	blood; for from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.
   142	
   143	During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,
   144	never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public.  It was
   145	then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger
   146	seriously to be avoided.  The question took quite another shape.  The
   147	monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite
   148	and shifting proportions.
   149	
   150	On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian, of the Montreal Ocean Company,
   151	finding herself during the night in 27° 30' lat. and 72° 15'
   152	long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for
   153	that part of the sea.  Under the combined efforts of the wind and its
   154	four hundred horse power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.
   155	Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the Moravian,
   156	she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with the 237
   157	passengers she was bringing home from Canada.
   158	
   159	The accident happened about five o'clock in the morning, as the day was
   160	breaking.  The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part
   161	of the vessel.  They examined the sea with the most careful attention.
   162	They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables' length distant,
   163	as if the surface had been violently agitated.  The bearings of the
   164	place were taken exactly, and the Moravian continued its route without
   165	apparent damage.  Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an enormous
   166	wreck?  They could not tell; but, on examination of the ship's bottom
   167	when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was broken.
   168	
   169	This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like
   170	many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under
   171	similar circumstances.  But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of
   172	the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel
   173	belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.
   174	
   175	The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze
   176	favourable, the Scotia, of the Cunard Company's line, found herself in
   177	15° 12' long. and 45° 37' lat.  She was going at the speed of
   178	thirteen knots and a half.
   179	
   180	At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers
   181	were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on
   182	the hull of the Scotia, on her quarter, a little aft of the port-paddle.
   183	
   184	The Scotia had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by
   185	something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt.  The shock had been
   186	so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts
   187	of the carpenter's watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, "We
   188	are sinking! we are sinking!"  At first the passengers were much
   189	frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them.  The danger
   190	could not be imminent.  The Scotia, divided into seven compartments by
   191	strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak.  Captain
   192	Anderson went down immediately into the hold.  He found that the sea
   193	was pouring into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx
   194	proved that the force of the water was considerable.  Fortunately this
   195	compartment did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been
   196	immediately extinguished.  Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be
   197	stopped at once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent
   198	of the injury.  Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence
   199	of a large hole, two yards in diameter, in the ship's bottom.  Such a
   200	leak could not be stopped; and the Scotia, her paddles half submerged,
   201	was obliged to continue her course.  She was then three hundred miles
   202	from Cape Clear, and, after three days' delay, which caused great
   203	uneasiness in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.
   204	
   205	The engineers visited the Scotia, which was put in dry dock.  They
   206	could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below
   207	water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.
   208	The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it
   209	could not have been more neatly done by a punch.  It was clear, then,
   210	that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common stamp
   211	and, after having been driven with prodigious strength, and piercing an
   212	iron plate 1 3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a backward
   213	motion.
   214	
   215	Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the
   216	torrent of public opinion.  From this moment all unlucky casualties
   217	which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the monster.
   218	
   219	Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all these
   220	shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three
   221	thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd's, the number
   222	of sailing and steam-ships supposed to be totally lost, from the
   223	absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!
   224	
   225	Now, it was the "monster" who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their
   226	disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different
   227	continents became more and more dangerous.  The public demanded sharply
   228	that the seas should at any price be relieved from this formidable
   229	cetacean.[1]

   236	CHAPTER II
   237	
   238	PRO AND CON
   239	
   240	At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a
   241	scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the
   242	United States.  In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the
   243	Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached
   244	me to that expedition.  After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New
   245	York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection.  My
   246	departure for France was fixed for the first days in May.  Meanwhile I
   247	was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and
   248	zoological riches, when the accident happened to the Scotia.
   249	
   250	I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.
   251	How could I be otherwise?  I had read and reread all the American and
   252	European papers without being any nearer a conclusion.  This mystery
   253	puzzled me.  Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped
   254	from one extreme to the other.  That there really was something could
   255	not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on
   256	the wound of the Scotia.
   257	
   258	On my arrival at New York the question was at its height.  The theory
   259	of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank, supported by
   260	minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.  And, indeed,
   261	unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could it change its
   262	position with such astonishing rapidity?
   263	
   264	From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck
   265	was given up.
   266	
   267	There remained, then, only two possible solutions of the question,
   268	which created two distinct parties:  on one side, those who were for a
   269	monster of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a
   270	submarine vessel of enormous motive power.
   271	
   272	But this last theory, plausible as it was, could not stand against
   273	inquiries made in both worlds.  That a private gentleman should have
   274	such a machine at his command was not likely.  Where, when, and how was
   275	it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?
   276	Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine.  And
   277	in these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the
   278	power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of
   279	others, a State might try to work such a formidable engine.
   280	
   281	But the idea of a war machine fell before the declaration of
   282	Governments.  As public interest was in question, and transatlantic
   283	communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted.  But how
   284	admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the
   285	public eye?  For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such
   286	circumstances would be very difficult, and for a State whose every act
   287	is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.
   288	
   289	Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of
   290	consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  I had published in France
   291	a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled Mysteries of the Great
   292	Submarine Grounds.  This book, highly approved of in the learned world,
   293	gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of
   294	Natural History.  My advice was asked.  As long as I could deny the
   295	reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative.  But
   296	soon, finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain
   297	myself point by point.  I discussed the question in all its forms,
   298	politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from a
   299	carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th
   300	of April.  It ran as follows:
   301	
   302	"After examining one by one the different theories, rejecting all other
   303	suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a marine
   304	animal of enormous power.
   305	
   306	"The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us.  Soundings
   307	cannot reach them.  What passes in those remote depths--what beings
   308	live, or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the
   309	waters--what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely
   310	conjecture.  However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may
   311	modify the form of the dilemma.  Either we do know all the varieties of
   312	beings which people our planet, or we do not.  If we do NOT know them
   313	all--if Nature has still secrets in the deeps for us, nothing is more
   314	conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or
   315	cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation
   316	formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an
   317	accident of some sort has brought at long intervals to the upper level
   318	of the ocean.
   319	
   320	"If, on the contrary, we DO know all living kinds, we must necessarily
   321	seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings already
   322	classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the existence
   323	of a gigantic narwhal.
   324	
   325	"The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of
   326	sixty feet.  Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength
   327	proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you
   328	obtain the animal required.  It will have the proportions determined by
   329	the officers of the Shannon, the instrument required by the perforation
   330	of the Scotia, and the power necessary to pierce the hull of the
   331	steamer.
   332	
   333	"Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,
   334	according to the expression of certain naturalists.  The principal tusk
   335	has the hardness of steel.  Some of these tusks have been found buried
   336	in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.
   337	Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of
   338	ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces
   339	a barrel.  The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one
   340	of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and
   341	fifteen inches in diameter at the base.
   342	
   343	"Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal
   344	ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,
   345	and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.
   346	Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a
   347	sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with
   348	a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the `rams' of war, whose
   349	massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time.  Thus
   350	may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something
   351	over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or
   352	experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility."
   353	
   354	These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,
   355	I wished to shelter my dignity as professor, and not give too much
   356	cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.
   357	I reserved for myself a way of escape.  In effect, however, I admitted
   358	the existence of the "monster." My article was warmly discussed, which
   359	procured it a high reputation.  It rallied round it a certain number of
   360	partisans.  The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to
   361	the imagination.  The human mind delights in grand conceptions of
   362	supernatural beings.  And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the
   363	only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial
   364	animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be
   365	produced or developed.
   366	
   367	The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from
   368	this point of view.  The Shipping and Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's
   369	List, the Packet-Boat, and the Maritime and Colonial Review, all papers
   370	devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their rates of
   371	premium, were unanimous on this point.  Public opinion had been
   372	pronounced.  The United States were the first in the field; and in New
   373	York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this
   374	narwhal.  A frigate of great speed, the Abraham Lincoln, was put in
   375	commission as soon as possible.  The arsenals were opened to Commander
   376	Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always
   377	happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster
   378	did not appear.  For two months no one heard it spoken of.  No ship met
   379	with it.  It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around
   380	it.  It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,
   381	that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on
   382	its passage and was making the most of it.
   383	
   384	So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided
   385	with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to
   386	pursue.  Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned
   387	that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to
   388	Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific
   389	Ocean.  The excitement caused by this news was extreme.  The ship was
   390	revictualled and well stocked with coal.
   391	
   392	Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn pier, I received a
   393	letter worded as follows:
   394	
   395	To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,
   396	New York.
   397	
   398	SIR,--If you will consent to join the Abraham Lincoln in this
   399	expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see
   400	France represented in the enterprise.  Commander Farragut has a cabin
   401	at your disposal.
   402	
   403	Very cordially yours, J.B. HOBSON, Secretary of Marine.
   404	
   405	
   406	
   407	CHAPTER III
   408	
   409	I FORM MY RESOLUTION
   410	
   411	Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter I no more
   412	thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the
   413	North Sea.  Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable
   414	Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my
   415	life, was to chase this disturbing monster and purge it from the world.
   416	
   417	But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for
   418	repose.  I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my
   419	friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and
   420	precious collections--but nothing could keep me back!  I forgot
   421	all--fatigue, friends and collections--and accepted without hesitation
   422	the offer of the American Government.
   423	
   424	"Besides," thought I, "all roads lead back to Europe; and the unicorn
   425	may be amiable enough to hurry me towards the coast of France.  This
   426	worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe (for
   427	my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard
   428	of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History." But in the
   429	meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,
   430	to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.
   431	
   432	"Conseil," I called in an impatient voice.
   433	
   434	Conseil was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had
   435	accompanied me in all my travels.  I liked him, and he returned the
   436	liking well.  He was quiet by nature, regular from principle, zealous
   437	from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different surprises of
   438	life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service required of
   439	him; and, despite his name, never giving advice--even when asked for it.
   440	
   441	Conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.
   442	Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never
   443	make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might
   444	be, or however far away, whether China or Congo.  Besides all this, he
   445	had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no
   446	nerves; good morals are understood.  This boy was thirty years old, and
   447	his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty.  May I be excused
   448	for saying that I was forty years old?
   449	
   450	But Conseil had one fault:  he was ceremonious to a degree, and would
   451	never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes
   452	provoking.
   453	
   454	"Conseil," said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make
   455	preparations for my departure.
   456	
   457	Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy.  As a rule, I never asked him
   458	if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but
   459	this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the
   460	enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of
   461	sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell.  Here there was matter for
   462	reflection even to the most impassive man in the world.  What would
   463	Conseil say?
   464	
   465	"Conseil," I called a third time.
   466	
   467	Conseil appeared.
   468	
   469	"Did you call, sir?" said he, entering.
   470	
   471	"Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too.  We leave in
   472	two hours."
   473	
   474	"As you please, sir," replied Conseil, quietly.
   475	
   476	"Not an instant to lose; lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,
   477	coats, shirts, and stockings--without counting, as many as you can, and
   478	make haste."
   479	
   480	"And your collections, sir?" observed Conseil.
   481	
   482	"They will keep them at the hotel."
   483	
   484	"We are not returning to Paris, then?" said Conseil.
   485	
   486	"Oh! certainly," I answered, evasively, "by making a curve."
   487	
   488	"Will the curve please you, sir?"
   489	
   490	"Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all.  We
   491	take our passage in the Abraham, Lincoln."
   492	
   493	"As you think proper, sir," coolly replied Conseil.
   494	
   495	"You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster--the famous narwhal.
   496	We are going to purge it from the seas.  A glorious mission, but a
   497	dangerous one!  We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can be
   498	very capricious.  But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain
   499	who is pretty wide-awake."
   500	
   501	Our luggage was transported to the deck of the frigate immediately.  I
   502	hastened on board and asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors
   503	conducted me to the poop, where I found myself in the presence of a
   504	good-looking officer, who held out his hand to me.
   505	
   506	"Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?" said he.
   507	
   508	"Himself," replied I. "Commander Farragut?"
   509	
   510	"You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you."
   511	
   512	I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.
   513	
   514	The Abraham Lincoln had been well chosen and equipped for her new
   515	destination.  She was a frigate of great speed, fitted with
   516	high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.
   517	Under this the Abraham Lincoln attained the mean speed of nearly
   518	eighteen knots and a third an hour--a considerable speed, but,
   519	nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean.
   520	
   521	The interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical
   522	qualities.  I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after
   523	part, opening upon the gunroom.
   524	
   525	"We shall be well off here," said I to Conseil.
   526	
   527	"As well, by your honour's leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a
   528	whelk," said Conseil.
   529	
   530	I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the
   531	poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.
   532	
   533	At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be
   534	cast loose which held the Abraham Lincoln to the pier of Brooklyn.  So
   535	in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the frigate would have sailed
   536	without me.  I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and
   537	incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some
   538	suspicion.
   539	
   540	But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the
   541	seas in which the animal had been sighted.  He sent for the engineer.
   542	
   543	"Is the steam full on?" asked he.
   544	
   545	"Yes, sir," replied the engineer.
   546	
   547	"Go ahead," cried Commander Farragut.
   548	
   549	
   550	
   551	CHAPTER IV
   552	
   553	NED LAND
   554	
   555	Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded.
   556	His vessel and he were one.  He was the soul of it.  On the question of
   557	the monster there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the
   558	existence of the animal to be disputed on board.  He believed in it, as
   559	certain good women believe in the leviathan--by faith, not by reason.
   560	The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it.  Either
   561	Captain Farragut would kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the
   562	captain.  There was no third course.
   563	
   564	The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief.  They were
   565	ever chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a
   566	meeting, watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean.  More than
   567	one took up his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have
   568	cursed such a berth under any other circumstances.  As long as the sun
   569	described its daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose
   570	feet were burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render
   571	it unbearable; still the Abraham Lincoln had not yet breasted the
   572	suspected waters of the Pacific.  As to the ship's company, they
   573	desired nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist
   574	it on board, and despatch it.  They watched the sea with eager
   575	attention.
   576	
   577	Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand
   578	dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he
   579	cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.
   580	
   581	I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the Abraham Lincoln.
   582	
   583	For my own part I was not behind the others, and, left to no one my
   584	share of daily observations.  The frigate might have been called the
   585	Argus, for a hundred reasons.  Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to
   586	protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us
   587	all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on
   588	board.
   589	
   590	I have said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided his ship with
   591	every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean.  No whaler had ever
   592	been better armed.  We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon
   593	thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the
   594	explosive balls of the duck-gun.  On the forecastle lay the perfection
   595	of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in
   596	the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867.  This
   597	precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical
   598	projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.
   599	
   600	Thus the Abraham Lincoln wanted for no means of destruction; and, what
   601	was better still she had on board Ned Land, the prince of harpooners.
   602	
   603	Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who
   604	knew no equal in his dangerous occupation.  Skill, coolness, audacity,
   605	and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning
   606	whale to escape the stroke of his harpoon.
   607	
   608	Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six
   609	feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,
   610	and very passionate when contradicted.  His person attracted attention,
   611	but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular
   612	expression to his face.
   613	
   614	Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little
   615	communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain
   616	liking for me.  My nationality drew him to me, no doubt.  It was an
   617	opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of
   618	Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces.  The
   619	harpooner's family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe
   620	of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.
   621	
   622	Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved
   623	to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas.  He related
   624	his fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his
   625	recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to
   626	a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North.
   627	
   628	I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him.  We are old
   629	friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and
   630	cemented amidst extreme dangers.  Ah, brave Ned!  I ask no more than to
   631	live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the
   632	longer on your memory.
   633	
   634	Now, what was Ned Land's opinion upon the question of the marine
   635	monster?  I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was
   636	the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction.  He
   637	even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press
   638	upon him.  One magnificent evening, the 30th July (that is to say,
   639	three weeks after our departure), the frigate was abreast of Cape
   640	Blanc, thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had
   641	crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened
   642	less than seven hundred miles to the south.  Before eight days were
   643	over the Abraham Lincoln would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.
   644	
   645	Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and
   646	another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up
   647	to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man.  I naturally led up
   648	the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances
   649	of success or failure of the expedition.  But, seeing that Ned Land let
   650	me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.
   651	
   652	"Well, Ned," said I, "is it possible that you are not convinced of the
   653	existence of this cetacean that we are following?  Have you any
   654	particular reason for being so incredulous?"
   655	
   656	The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,
   657	struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to
   658	collect himself, and said at last, "Perhaps I have, Mr. Aronnax."
   659	
   660	"But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great
   661	marine mammalia--YOU ought to be the last to doubt under such
   662	circumstances!"
   663	
   664	"That is just what deceives you, Professor," replied Ned.  "As a whaler
   665	I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a great number, and killed
   666	several; but, however strong or well-armed they may have been, neither
   667	their tails nor their weapons would have been able even to scratch the
   668	iron plates of a steamer."
   669	
   670	"But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have
   671	pierced through and through."
   672	
   673	"Wooden ships--that is possible," replied the Canadian, "but I have
   674	never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,
   675	cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe."
   676	
   677	"Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of
   678	facts.  I believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised,
   679	belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,
   680	or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great
   681	penetrating power."
   682	
   683	"Hum!" said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who
   684	would not be convinced.
   685	
   686	"Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian," I resumed.  "If such an animal
   687	is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it
   688	frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it
   689	must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would
   690	defy all comparison."
   691	
   692	"And why this powerful organisation?" demanded Ned.
   693	
   694	"Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one's self in these
   695	strata and resist their pressure.  Listen to me.  Let us admit that the
   696	pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of
   697	water thirty-two feet high.  In reality the column of water would be
   698	shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is
   699	greater than that of fresh water.  Very well, when you dive, Ned, as
   700	many times 32 feet of water as there are above you, so many times does
   701	your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere, that is to
   702	say, 15 lb. for each square inch of its surface.  It follows, then,
   703	that at 320 feet this pressure equals that of 10 atmospheres, of 100
   704	atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and of 1,000 atmospheres at 32,000 feet,
   705	that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you could
   706	attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an inch of
   707	the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5,600 lb.  Ah! my
   708	brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the surface
   709	of your body?"
   710	
   711	"I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax."
   712	
   713	"About 6,500; and as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15
   714	lb.  to the square inch, your 6,500 square inches bear at this moment a
   715	pressure of 97,500 lb."
   716	
   717	"Without my perceiving it?"
   718	
   719	"Without your perceiving it.  And if you are not crushed by such a
   720	pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body
   721	with equal pressure.  Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior
   722	and exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which
   723	allows you to bear it without inconvenience.  But in the water it is
   724	another thing."
   725	
   726	"Yes, I understand," replied Ned, becoming more attentive; "because the
   727	water surrounds me, but does not penetrate."
   728	
   729	"Precisely, Ned:  so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you
   730	would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lb.; at 320 feet, ten times that
   731	pressure; at 3,200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at
   732	32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000
   733	lb.--that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been
   734	drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!"
   735	
   736	"The devil!" exclaimed Ned.
   737	
   738	"Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred
   739	yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such
   740	depths--of those whose surface is represented by millions of square
   741	inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the
   742	pressure they undergo.  Consider, then, what must be the resistance of
   743	their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to
   744	withstand such pressure!"
   745	
   746	"Why!" exclaimed Ned Land, "they must be made of iron plates eight
   747	inches thick, like the armoured frigates."
   748	
   749	"As you say, Ned.  And think what destruction such a mass would cause,
   750	if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a
   751	vessel."
   752	
   753	"Yes--certainly--perhaps," replied the Canadian, shaken by these
   754	figures, but not yet willing to give in.
   755	
   756	"Well, have I convinced you?"
   757	
   758	"You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such
   759	animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as
   760	strong as you say."
   761	
   762	"But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the
   763	accident to the Scotia?"
   764	
   765	
   766	
   767	CHAPTER V
   768	
   769	AT A VENTURE
   770	
   771	The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no
   772	special incident.  But one circumstance happened which showed the
   773	wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might
   774	place in him.
   775	
   776	The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we
   777	learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal.  But one of them, the
   778	captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the
   779	Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in
   780	sight.  Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave
   781	him permission to go on board the Monroe.  And fate served our Canadian
   782	so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double
   783	blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after
   784	some minutes' pursuit.
   785	
   786	Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land's harpoon, I
   787	would not bet in its favour.
   788	
   789	The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great
   790	rapidity.  The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of
   791	Magellan, level with Cape Vierges.  But Commander Farragut would not
   792	take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.
   793	
   794	The ship's crew agreed with him.  And certainly it was possible that
   795	they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass.  Many of the sailors
   796	affirmed that the monster could not pass there, "that he was too big
   797	for that!"
   798	
   799	The 6th of July, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the Abraham
   800	Lincoln, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,
   801	this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which
   802	some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The
   803	course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of
   804	the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.
   805	
   806	"Keep your eyes open!" called out the sailors.
   807	
   808	And they were opened widely.  Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,
   809	it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an
   810	instant's repose.
   811	
   812	I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on
   813	board.  Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,
   814	indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the
   815	vessel.  Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the
   816	taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the
   817	sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the
   818	emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised
   819	its black back above the waves!  The poop of the vessel was crowded on
   820	a moment.  The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers,
   821	each with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the
   822	cetacean.  I looked and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil
   823	kept repeating in a calm voice:
   824	
   825	"If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!"
   826	
   827	But vain excitement!  The Abraham Lincoln checked its speed and made
   828	for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which
   829	soon disappeared amidst a storm of abuse.
   830	
   831	But the weather was good.  The voyage was being accomplished under the
   832	most favourable auspices.  It was then the bad season in Australia, the
   833	July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea
   834	was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.
   835	
   836	The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105d of longitude,
   837	and the 27th of the same month we crossed the Equator on the 110th
   838	meridian.  This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly
   839	direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific.  Commander
   840	Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep
   841	water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself
   842	seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!
   843	suggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some
   844	distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the
   845	tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas.  We were on the theatre
   846	of the last diversions of the monster:  and, to say truth, we no longer
   847	LIVED on board.  The entire ship's crew were undergoing a nervous
   848	excitement, of which I can give no idea:  they could not eat, they
   849	could not sleep--twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical
   850	illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful
   851	perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a
   852	state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.
   853	
   854	And truly, reaction soon showed itself.  For three months, during which
   855	a day seemed an age, the Abraham Lincoln furrowed all the waters of the
   856	Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from her
   857	course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping suddenly,
   858	putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of deranging
   859	her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American coast was
   860	left unexplored.
   861	
   862	The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent
   863	detractors.  Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and
   864	certainly, had it not been for the resolute determination on the part
   865	of Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward.  This
   866	useless search could not last much longer.  The Abraham Lincoln had
   867	nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.
   868	Never had an American ship's crew shown more zeal or patience; its
   869	failure could not be placed to their charge--there remained nothing but
   870	to return.
   871	
   872	This was represented to the commander.  The sailors could not hide
   873	their discontent, and the service suffered.  I will not say there was a
   874	mutiny on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain
   875	Farragut (as Columbus did) asked for three days' patience.  If in three
   876	days the monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three
   877	turns of the wheel, and the Abraham Lincoln would make for the European
   878	seas.
   879	
   880	This promise was made on the 2nd of November.  It had the effect of
   881	rallying the ship's crew.  The ocean was watched with renewed
   882	attention.  Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his
   883	remembrance.  Glasses were used with feverish activity.  It was a grand
   884	defiance given to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to
   885	answer the summons and "appear."
   886	
   887	Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes
   888	were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the
   889	animal in case it should be met in those parts.  Large quantities of
   890	bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction
   891	(I must say) of the sharks.  Small craft radiated in all directions
   892	round the Abraham Lincoln as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of
   893	the sea unexplored.  But the night of the 4th of November arrived
   894	without the unveiling of this submarine mystery.
   895	
   896	The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally
   897	speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his
   898	promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever
   899	the northern regions of the Pacific.
   900	
   901	The frigate was then in 31° 15' N. lat. and 136° 42' E. long.
   902	The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred miles to
   903	leeward.  Night was approaching.  They had just struck eight bells;
   904	large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first quarter.
   905	The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.
   906	
   907	At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting.
   908	Conseil, standing near me, was looking straight before him.  The crew,
   909	perched in the ratlines, examined the horizon which contracted and
   910	darkened by degrees.  Officers with their night glasses scoured the
   911	growing darkness:  sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the
   912	moon, which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost
   913	in the darkness.
   914	
   915	In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the
   916	general influence.  At least I thought so.  Perhaps for the first time
   917	his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.
   918	
   919	"Come, Conseil," said I, "this is the last chance of pocketing the two
   920	thousand dollars."
   921	
   922	"May I be permitted to say, sir," replied Conseil, "that I never
   923	reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union
   924	offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the poorer."
   925	
   926	"You are right, Conseil.  It is a foolish affair after all, and one
   927	upon which we entered too lightly.  What time lost, what useless
   928	emotions!  We should have been back in France six months ago."
   929	
   930	"In your little room, sir," replied Conseil, "and in your museum, sir;
   931	and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir.  And the
   932	Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des
   933	Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!"
   934	
   935	"As you say, Conseil.  I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being
   936	laughed at for our pains."
   937	
   938	"That's tolerably certain," replied Conseil, quietly; "I think they
   939	will make fun of you, sir.  And, must I say it----?"
   940	
   941	"Go on, my good friend."
   942	
   943	"Well, sir, you will only get your deserts."
   944	
   945	"Indeed!"
   946	
   947	"When one has the honour of being a _savant_ as you are, sir, one should
   948	not expose one's self to----"
   949	
   950	Conseil had not time to finish his compliment.  In the midst of general
   951	silence a voice had just been heard.  It was the voice of Ned Land
   952	shouting:
   953	
   954	"Look out there!  The very thing we are looking for--on our weather
   955	beam!"
   956	
   957	
   958	
   959	CHAPTER VI
   960	
   961	AT FULL STEAM
   962	
   963	At this cry the whole ship's crew hurried towards the
   964	harpooner--commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the
   965	engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.
   966	
   967	The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went
   968	on by her own momentum.  The darkness was then profound, and, however
   969	good the Canadian's eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to
   970	see, and what he had been able to see.  My heart beat as if it would
   971	break.  But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object
   972	he pointed to.  At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln, on the
   973	starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over.  It was
   974	not a mere phosphoric phenomenon.  The monster emerged some fathoms
   975	from the water, and then threw out that very intense but mysterious
   976	light mentioned in the report of several captains.  This magnificent
   977	irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great SHINING power.
   978	The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much elongated,
   979	the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose overpowering
   980	brilliancy died out by successive gradations.
   981	
   982	"It is only a massing of phosphoric particles," cried one of the
   983	officers.
   984	
   985	"No, sir, certainly not," I replied.  "That brightness is of an
   986	essentially electrical nature.  Besides, see, see! it moves; it is
   987	moving forwards, backwards; it is darting towards us!"
   988	
   989	A general cry arose from the frigate.
   990	
   991	"Silence!" said the captain.  "Up with the helm, reverse the engines."
   992	
   993	The steam was shut off, and the Abraham Lincoln, beating to port,
   994	described a semicircle.
   995	
   996	"Right the helm, go ahead," cried the captain.
   997	
   998	These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the
   999	burning light.
  1000	
  1001	I was mistaken.  She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal
  1002	approached with a velocity double her own.
  1003	
  1004	We gasped for breath.  Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and
  1005	motionless.  The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves.  It made
  1006	the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and
  1007	enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust.
  1008	
  1009	Then it moved away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track,
  1010	like those volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind.  All
  1011	at once from the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain
  1012	its momentum, the monster rushed suddenly towards the Abraham Lincoln
  1013	with alarming rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the
  1014	hull, and died out--not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did
  1015	not abate--but suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant
  1016	emanation was exhausted.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the
  1017	vessel, as if it had turned and slid under the hull.  Any moment a
  1018	collision might have occurred which would have been fatal to us.
  1019	However, I was astonished at the manoeuvres of the frigate.  She fled
  1020	and did not attack.
  1021	
  1022	On the captain's face, generally so impassive, was an expression of
  1023	unaccountable astonishment.
  1024	
  1025	"Mr. Aronnax," he said, "I do not know with what formidable being I
  1026	have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst
  1027	of this darkness.  Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend
  1028	one's self from it?  Wait for daylight, and the scene will change."
  1029	
  1030	"You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?"
  1031	
  1032	"No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one."
  1033	
  1034	"Perhaps," added I, "one can only approach it with a torpedo."
  1035	
  1036	"Undoubtedly," replied the captain, "if it possesses such dreadful
  1037	power, it is the most terrible animal that ever was created.  That is
  1038	why, sir, I must be on my guard."
  1039	
  1040	The crew were on their feet all night.  No one thought of sleep.  The
  1041	Abraham Lincoln, not being able to struggle with such velocity, had
  1042	moderated its pace, and sailed at half speed.  For its part, the
  1043	narwhal, imitating the frigate, let the waves rock it at will, and
  1044	seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle.  Towards
  1045	midnight, however, it disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term,
  1046	it "died out" like a large glow-worm. Had it fled?  One could only
  1047	fear, not hope it.  But at seven minutes to one o'clock in the morning
  1048	a deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water
  1049	rushing with great violence.
  1050	
  1051	The captain, Ned Land, and I were then on the poop, eagerly peering
  1052	through the profound darkness.
  1053	
  1054	"Ned Land," asked the commander, "you have often heard the roaring of
  1055	whales?"
  1056	
  1057	"Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two
  1058	thousand dollars.  If I can only approach within four harpoons' length
  1059	of it!"
  1060	
  1061	"But to approach it," said the commander, "I ought to put a whaler at
  1062	your disposal?"
  1063	
  1064	"Certainly, sir."
  1065	
  1066	"That will be trifling with the lives of my men."
  1067	
  1068	"And mine too," simply said the harpooner.
  1069	
  1070	Towards two o'clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not
  1071	less intense, about five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln.
  1072	Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one
  1073	heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal's tail, and even its
  1074	panting breath.  It seemed that, at the moment that the enormous
  1075	narwhal had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air
  1076	was engulfed in its lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a
  1077	machine of two thousand horse-power.
  1078	
  1079	"Hum!" thought I, "a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment
  1080	would be a pretty whale!"
  1081	
  1082	We were on the qui vive till daylight, and prepared for the combat.
  1083	The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings.  The
  1084	second lieutenant loaded the blunder busses, which could throw harpoons
  1085	to the distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets,
  1086	which inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals.  Ned
  1087	Land contented himself with sharpening his harpoon--a terrible weapon
  1088	in his hands.
  1089	
  1090	At six o'clock day began to break; and, with the first glimmer of
  1091	light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared.  At seven o'clock
  1092	the day was sufficiently advanced, but a very thick sea fog obscured
  1093	our view, and the best spy glasses could not pierce it.  That caused
  1094	disappointment and anger.
  1095	
  1096	I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the
  1097	mast-heads. At eight o'clock the fog lay heavily on the waves, and its
  1098	thick scrolls rose little by little.  The horizon grew wider and
  1099	clearer at the same time.  Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned
  1100	Land's voice was heard:
  1101	
  1102	"The thing itself on the port quarter!" cried the harpooner.
  1103	
  1104	Every eye was turned towards the point indicated.  There, a mile and a
  1105	half from the frigate, a long blackish body emerged a yard above the
  1106	waves.  Its tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy.
  1107	Never did a tail beat the sea with such violence.  An immense track, of
  1108	dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of the animal, and described a
  1109	long curve.
  1110	
  1111	The frigate approached the cetacean.  I examined it thoroughly.
  1112	
  1113	The reports of the Shannon and of the Helvetia had rather exaggerated
  1114	its size, and I estimated its length at only two hundred and fifty
  1115	feet.  As to its dimensions, I could only conjecture them to be
  1116	admirably proportioned.  While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of
  1117	steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of
  1118	120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing.  I concluded
  1119	definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch, class mammalia.
  1120	
  1121	The crew waited impatiently for their chief's orders.  The latter,
  1122	after having observed the animal attentively, called the engineer.  The
  1123	engineer ran to him.
  1124	
  1125	"Sir," said the commander, "you have steam up?"
  1126	
  1127	"Yes, sir," answered the engineer.
  1128	
  1129	"Well, make up your fires and put on all steam."
  1130	
  1131	Three hurrahs greeted this order.  The time for the struggle had
  1132	arrived.  Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited
  1133	torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of
  1134	the boilers.
  1135	
  1136	The Abraham Lincoln, propelled by her wonderful screw, went straight at
  1137	the animal.  The latter allowed it to come within half a cable's
  1138	length; then, as if disdaining to dive, it took a little turn, and
  1139	stopped a short distance off.
  1140	
  1141	This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the
  1142	frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean.  It was quite evident that
  1143	at that rate we should never come up with it.
  1144	
  1145	"Well, Mr. Land," asked the captain, "do you advise me to put the boats
  1146	out to sea?"
  1147	
  1148	"No, sir," replied Ned Land; "because we shall not take that beast
  1149	easily."
  1150	
  1151	"What shall we do then?"
  1152	
  1153	"Put on more steam if you can, sir.  With your leave, I mean to post
  1154	myself under the bowsprit, and, if we get within harpooning distance, I
  1155	shall throw my harpoon."
  1156	
  1157	"Go, Ned," said the captain.  "Engineer, put on more pressure."
  1158	
  1159	Ned Land went to his post.  The fires were increased, the screw
  1160	revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the
  1161	valves.  We heaved the log, and calculated that the Abraham Lincoln was
  1162	going at the rate of 18 1/2 miles an hour.
  1163	
  1164	But the accursed animal swam at the same speed.
  1165	
  1166	For a whole hour the frigate kept up this pace, without gaining six
  1167	feet.  It was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the
  1168	American navy.  A stubborn anger seized the crew; the sailors abused
  1169	the monster, who, as before, disdained to answer them; the captain no
  1170	longer contented himself with twisting his beard--he gnawed it.
  1171	
  1172	The engineer was called again.
  1173	
  1174	"You have turned full steam on?"
  1175	
  1176	"Yes, sir," replied the engineer.
  1177	
  1178	The speed of the Abraham Lincoln increased.  Its masts trembled down to
  1179	their stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way out
  1180	of the narrow funnels.
  1181	
  1182	They heaved the log a second time.
  1183	
  1184	"Well?" asked the captain of the man at the wheel.
  1185	
  1186	"Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir."
  1187	
  1188	"Clap on more steam."
  1189	
  1190	The engineer obeyed.  The manometer showed ten degrees.  But the
  1191	cetacean grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it
  1192	made 19 3/10 miles.
  1193	
  1194	What a pursuit!  No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated
  1195	through me.  Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand.  Several times
  1196	the animal let us gain upon it.--"We shall catch it! we shall catch
  1197	it!" cried the Canadian.  But just as he was going to strike, the
  1198	cetacean stole away with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less
  1199	than thirty miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it
  1200	bullied the frigate, going round and round it.  A cry of fury broke
  1201	from everyone!
  1202	
  1203	At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o'clock in the
  1204	morning.
  1205	
  1206	The captain then decided to take more direct means.
  1207	
  1208	"Ah!" said he, "that animal goes quicker than the Abraham Lincoln.
  1209	Very well! we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets.
  1210	Send your men to the forecastle, sir."
  1211	
  1212	The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round.  But the
  1213	shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off.
  1214	
  1215	"Another, more to the right," cried the commander, "and five dollars to
  1216	whoever will hit that infernal beast."
  1217	
  1218	An old gunner with a grey beard--that I can see now--with steady eye
  1219	and grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim.  A loud report
  1220	was heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew.
  1221	
  1222	The bullet did its work; it hit the animal, and, sliding off the
  1223	rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea.
  1224	
  1225	The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said:
  1226	
  1227	"I will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up."
  1228	
  1229	"Yes," answered I; "and you will be quite right to do it."
  1230	
  1231	I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to
  1232	fatigue like a steam engine.  But it was of no use.  Hours passed,
  1233	without its showing any signs of exhaustion.
  1234	
  1235	However, it must be said in praise of the Abraham Lincoln that she
  1236	struggled on indefatigably.  I cannot reckon the distance she made
  1237	under three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th.
  1238	But night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean.
  1239	
  1240	Now I thought our expedition was at an end, and that we should never
  1241	again see the extraordinary animal.  I was mistaken.  At ten minutes to
  1242	eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to
  1243	windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding
  1244	night.
  1245	
  1246	The narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with its day's work, it
  1247	slept, letting itself float with the undulation of the waves.  Now was
  1248	a chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage.
  1249	
  1250	He gave his orders.  The Abraham Lincoln kept up half steam, and
  1251	advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary.  It is no rare
  1252	thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that
  1253	they can be successfully attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than
  1254	one during its sleep.  The Canadian went to take his place again under
  1255	the bowsprit.
  1256	
  1257	The frigate approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables' lengths from
  1258	the animal, and following its track.  No one breathed; a deep silence
  1259	reigned on the bridge.  We were not a hundred feet from the burning
  1260	focus, the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes.
  1261	
  1262	At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned
  1263	Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible
  1264	harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal.
  1265	Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the
  1266	sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body.
  1267	The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts
  1268	broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem
  1269	to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars.  A
  1270	fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time
  1271	to stop myself, I fell into the sea.
  1272	
  1273	
  1274	
  1275	CHAPTER VII
  1276	
  1277	AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE
  1278	
  1279	This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of
  1280	my sensations at the time.  I was at first drawn down to a depth of
  1281	about twenty feet.  I am a good swimmer (though without pretending to
  1282	rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in that
  1283	plunge I did not lose my presence of mind.  Two vigorous strokes
  1284	brought me to the surface of the water.  My first care was to look for
  1285	the frigate.  Had the crew seen me disappear?  Had the Abraham Lincoln
  1286	veered round?  Would the captain put out a boat?  Might I hope to be
  1287	saved?
  1288	
  1289	The darkness was intense.  I caught a glimpse of a black mass
  1290	disappearing in the east, its beacon lights dying out in the distance.
  1291	It was the frigate!  I was lost.
  1292	
  1293	"Help, help!"  I shouted, swimming towards the Abraham Lincoln in
  1294	desperation.
  1295	
  1296	My clothes encumbered me; they seemed glued to my body, and paralysed
  1297	my movements.
  1298	
  1299	I was sinking!  I was suffocating!
  1300	
  1301	"Help!"
  1302	
  1303	This was my last cry.  My mouth filled with water; I struggled against
  1304	being drawn down the abyss.  Suddenly my clothes were seized by a
  1305	strong hand, and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the
  1306	sea; and I heard, yes, I heard these words pronounced in my ear:
  1307	
  1308	"If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, master would
  1309	swim with much greater ease."
  1310	
  1311	I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil's arm.
  1312	
  1313	"Is it you?" said I, "you?"
  1314	
  1315	"Myself," answered Conseil; "and waiting master's orders."
  1316	
  1317	"That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?"
  1318	
  1319	"No; but, being in my master's service, I followed him."
  1320	
  1321	The worthy fellow thought that was but natural.
  1322	
  1323	"And the frigate?"  I asked.
  1324	
  1325	"The frigate?" replied Conseil, turning on his back; "I think that
  1326	master had better not count too much on her."
  1327	
  1328	"You think so?"
  1329	
  1330	"I say that, at the time I threw myself into the sea, I heard the men
  1331	at the wheel say, `The screw and the rudder are broken.'
  1332	
  1333	"Broken?"
  1334	
  1335	"Yes, broken by the monster's teeth.  It is the only injury the Abraham
  1336	Lincoln has sustained.  But it is a bad look-out for us--she no longer
  1337	answers her helm."
  1338	
  1339	"Then we are lost!"
  1340	
  1341	"Perhaps so," calmly answered Conseil.  "However, we have still several
  1342	hours before us, and one can do a good deal in some hours."
  1343	
  1344	Conseil's imperturbable coolness set me up again.  I swam more
  1345	vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden
  1346	weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up.  Conseil saw this.
  1347	
  1348	"Will master let me make a slit?" said he; and, slipping an open knife
  1349	under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly.
  1350	Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.
  1351	
  1352	Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each
  1353	other.
  1354	
  1355	Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible.  Perhaps our
  1356	disappearance had not been noticed; and, if it had been, the frigate
  1357	could not tack, being without its helm.  Conseil argued on this
  1358	supposition, and laid his plans accordingly.  This quiet boy was
  1359	perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of
  1360	safety was being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's boats, we ought to
  1361	manage so as to wait for them as long as possible.  I resolved then to
  1362	husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the same
  1363	time; and this is how we managed:  while one of us lay on our back,
  1364	quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would
  1365	swim and push the other on in front.  This towing business did not last
  1366	more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, we could
  1367	swim on for some hours, perhaps till day-break. Poor chance! but hope
  1368	is so firmly rooted in the heart of man!  Moreover, there were two of
  1369	us.  Indeed I declare (though it may seem improbable) if I sought to
  1370	destroy all hope--if I wished to despair, I could not.
  1371	
  1372	The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about
  1373	eleven o'clock in the evening before.  I reckoned then we should have
  1374	eight hours to swim before sunrise, an operation quite practicable if
  1375	we relieved each other.  The sea, very calm, was in our favour.
  1376	Sometimes I tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only
  1377	dispelled by the phosphorescence caused by our movements.  I watched
  1378	the luminous waves that broke over my hand, whose mirror-like surface
  1379	was spotted with silvery rings.  One might have said that we were in a
  1380	bath of quicksilver.
  1381	
  1382	Near one o'clock in the morning, I was seized with dreadful fatigue.
  1383	My limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp.  Conseil was
  1384	obliged to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone.  I
  1385	heard the poor boy pant; his breathing became short and hurried.  I
  1386	found that he could not keep up much longer.
  1387	
  1388	"Leave me! leave me!"  I said to him.
  1389	
  1390	"Leave my master?  Never!" replied he.  "I would drown first."
  1391	
  1392	Just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that
  1393	the wind was driving to the east.  The surface of the sea glittered
  1394	with its rays.  This kindly light reanimated us.  My head got better
  1395	again.  I looked at all points of the horizon.  I saw the frigate!  She
  1396	was five miles from us, and looked like a dark mass, hardly
  1397	discernible.  But no boats!
  1398	
  1399	I would have cried out.  But what good would it have been at such a
  1400	distance!  My swollen lips could utter no sounds.  Conseil could
  1401	articulate some words, and I heard him repeat at intervals, "Help!
  1402	help!"
  1403	
  1404	Our movements were suspended for an instant; we listened.  It might be
  1405	only a singing in the ear, but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the
  1406	cry from Conseil.
  1407	
  1408	"Did you hear?"  I murmured.
  1409	
  1410	"Yes!  Yes!"
  1411	
  1412	And Conseil gave one more despairing cry.
  1413	
  1414	This time there was no mistake!  A human voice responded to ours!  Was
  1415	it the voice of another unfortunate creature, abandoned in the middle
  1416	of the ocean, some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel?
  1417	Or rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the
  1418	darkness?
  1419	
  1420	Conseil made a last effort, and, leaning on my shoulder, while I struck
  1421	out in a desperate effort, he raised himself half out of the water,
  1422	then fell back exhausted.
  1423	
  1424	"What did you see?"
  1425	
  1426	"I saw----" murmured he; "I saw--but do not talk--reserve all your
  1427	strength!"
  1428	
  1429	What had he seen?  Then, I know not why, the thought of the monster
  1430	came into my head for the first time!  But that voice!  The time is
  1431	past for Jonahs to take refuge in whales' bellies!  However, Conseil
  1432	was towing me again.  He raised his head sometimes, looked before us,
  1433	and uttered a cry of recognition, which was responded to by a voice
  1434	that came nearer and nearer.  I scarcely heard it.  My strength was
  1435	exhausted; my fingers stiffened; my hand afforded me support no longer;
  1436	my mouth, convulsively opening, filled with salt water.  Cold crept
  1437	over me.  I raised my head for the last time, then I sank.
  1438	
  1439	At this moment a hard body struck me.  I clung to it: then I felt that
  1440	I was being drawn up, that I was brought to the surface of the water,
  1441	that my chest collapsed--I fainted.
  1442	
  1443	It is certain that I soon came to, thanks to the vigorous rubbings that
  1444	I received.  I half opened my eyes.
  1445	
  1446	"Conseil!"  I murmured.
  1447	
  1448	"Does master call me?" asked Conseil.
  1449	
  1450	Just then, by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to
  1451	the horizon, I saw a face which was not Conseil's and which I
  1452	immediately recognised.
  1453	
  1454	"Ned!"  I cried.
  1455	
  1456	"The same, sir, who is seeking his prize!" replied the Canadian.
  1457	
  1458	"Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?"
  1459	
  1460	"Yes, Professor; but more fortunate than you, I was able to find a
  1461	footing almost directly upon a floating island."
  1462	
  1463	"An island?"
  1464	
  1465	"Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal."
  1466	
  1467	"Explain yourself, Ned!"
  1468	
  1469	"Only I soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was
  1470	blunted."
  1471	
  1472	"Why, Ned, why?"
  1473	
  1474	"Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron."
  1475	
  1476	The Canadian's last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain.  I
  1477	wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of
  1478	the water, which served us for a refuge.  I kicked it.  It was
  1479	evidently a hard, impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that
  1480	forms the bodies of the great marine mammalia.  But this hard body
  1481	might be a bony covering, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I
  1482	should be free to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as
  1483	tortoises or alligators.
  1484	
  1485	Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished,
  1486	without scales.  The blow produced a metallic sound; and, incredible
  1487	though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted
  1488	plates.
  1489	
  1490	There was no doubt about it!  This monster, this natural phenomenon
  1491	that had puzzled the learned world, and over thrown and misled the
  1492	imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned was a still
  1493	more astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch as it was a simply human
  1494	construction.
  1495	
  1496	We had no time to lose, however.  We were lying upon the back of a sort
  1497	of submarine boat, which appeared (as far as I could judge) like a huge
  1498	fish of steel.  Ned Land's mind was made up on this point.  Conseil and
  1499	I could only agree with him.
  1500	
  1501	Just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing (which was
  1502	evidently propelled by a screw), and it began to move.  We had only
  1503	just time to seize hold of the upper part, which rose about seven feet
  1504	out of the water, and happily its speed was not great.
  1505	
  1506	"As long as it sails horizontally," muttered Ned Land, "I do not mind;
  1507	but, if it takes a fancy to dive, I would not give two straws for my
  1508	life."
  1509	
  1510	The Canadian might have said still less.  It became really necessary to
  1511	communicate with the beings, whatever they were, shut up inside the
  1512	machine.  I searched all over the outside for an aperture, a panel, or
  1513	a manhole, to use a technical expression; but the lines of the iron
  1514	rivets, solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates, were clear
  1515	and uniform.  Besides, the moon disappeared then, and left us in total
  1516	darkness.
  1517	
  1518	At last this long night passed.  My indistinct remembrance prevents my
  1519	describing all the impressions it made.  I can only recall one
  1520	circumstance.  During some lulls of the wind and sea, I fancied I heard
  1521	several times vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced by
  1522	words of command.  What was, then, the mystery of this submarine craft,
  1523	of which the whole world vainly sought an explanation?  What kind of
  1524	beings existed in this strange boat?  What mechanical agent caused its
  1525	prodigious speed?
  1526	
  1527	Daybreak appeared.  The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon
  1528	cleared off.  I was about to examine the hull, which formed on deck a
  1529	kind of horizontal platform, when I felt it gradually sinking.
  1530	
  1531	"Oh! confound it!" cried Ned Land, kicking the resounding plate.
  1532	"Open, you inhospitable rascals!"
  1533	
  1534	Happily the sinking movement ceased.  Suddenly a noise, like iron works
  1535	violently pushed aside, came from the interior of the boat.  One iron
  1536	plate was moved, a man appeared, uttered an odd cry, and disappeared
  1537	immediately.
  1538	
  1539	Some moments after, eight strong men, with masked faces, appeared
  1540	noiselessly, and drew us down into their formidable machine.
  1541	
  1542	
  1543	
  1544	CHAPTER VIII
  1545	
  1546	MOBILIS IN MOBILI
  1547	
  1548	This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with
  1549	the rapidity of lightning.  I shivered all over.  Whom had we to deal
  1550	with?  No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their
  1551	own way.  Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was
  1552	enveloped in darkness.  My eyes, dazzled with the outer light, could
  1553	distinguish nothing.  I felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an
  1554	iron ladder.  Ned Land and Conseil, firmly seized, followed me.  At the
  1555	bottom of the ladder, a door opened, and shut after us immediately with
  1556	a bang.
  1557	
  1558	We were alone.  Where, I could not say, hardly imagine.  All was black,
  1559	and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been
  1560	able to discern even the faintest glimmer.
  1561	
  1562	Meanwhile, Ned Land, furious at these proceedings, gave free vent to
  1563	his indignation.
  1564	
  1565	"Confound it!" cried he, "here are people who come up to the Scotch for
  1566	hospitality.  They only just miss being cannibals.  I should not be
  1567	surprised at it, but I declare that they shall not eat me without my
  1568	protesting."
  1569	
  1570	"Calm yourself, friend Ned, calm yourself," replied Conseil, quietly.
  1571	"Do not cry out before you are hurt.  We are not quite done for yet."
  1572	
  1573	"Not quite," sharply replied the Canadian, "but pretty near, at all
  1574	events.  Things look black.  Happily, my bowie knife I have still, and
  1575	I can always see well enough to use it.  The first of these pirates who
  1576	lays a hand on me----"
  1577	
  1578	"Do not excite yourself, Ned," I said to the harpooner, "and do not
  1579	compromise us by useless violence.  Who knows that they will not listen
  1580	to us?  Let us rather try to find out where we are."
  1581	
  1582	I groped about.  In five steps I came to an iron wall, made of plates
  1583	bolted together.  Then turning back I struck against a wooden table,
  1584	near which were ranged several stools.  The boards of this prison were
  1585	concealed under a thick mat, which deadened the noise of the feet.  The
  1586	bare walls revealed no trace of window or door.  Conseil, going round
  1587	the reverse way, met me, and we went back to the middle of the cabin,
  1588	which measured about twenty feet by ten.  As to its height, Ned Land,
  1589	in spite of his own great height, could not measure it.
  1590	
  1591	Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered,
  1592	when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light.  Our prison
  1593	was suddenly lighted, that is to say, it became filled with a luminous
  1594	matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first.  In its whiteness
  1595	and intensity I recognised that electric light which played round the
  1596	submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence.  After
  1597	shutting my eyes involuntarily, I opened them, and saw that this
  1598	luminous agent came from a half globe, unpolished, placed in the roof
  1599	of the cabin.
  1600	
  1601	"At last one can see," cried Ned Land, who, knife in hand, stood on the
  1602	defensive.
  1603	
  1604	"Yes," said I; "but we are still in the dark about ourselves."
  1605	
  1606	"Let master have patience," said the imperturbable Conseil.
  1607	
  1608	The sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely.  It
  1609	only contained a table and five stools.  The invisible door might be
  1610	hermetically sealed.  No noise was heard.  All seemed dead in the
  1611	interior of this boat.  Did it move, did it float on the surface of the
  1612	ocean, or did it dive into its depths?  I could not guess.
  1613	
  1614	A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared.
  1615	
  1616	One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs,
  1617	strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick
  1618	penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population
  1619	of Southern France.
  1620	
  1621	The second stranger merits a more detailed description.  I made out his
  1622	prevailing qualities directly:  self-confidence--because his head was
  1623	well set on his shoulders, and his black eyes looked around with cold
  1624	assurance; calmness--for his skin, rather pale, showed his coolness of
  1625	blood; energy--evinced by the rapid contraction of his lofty brows; and
  1626	courage--because his deep breathing denoted great power of lungs.
  1627	
  1628	Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could not
  1629	say.  He was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut
  1630	mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly
  1631	nervous temperament.  This man was certainly the most admirable
  1632	specimen I had ever met.  One particular feature was his eyes, rather
  1633	far from each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the
  1634	horizon at once.
  1635	
  1636	This faculty--(I verified it later)--gave him a range of vision far
  1637	superior to Ned Land's. When this stranger fixed upon an object, his
  1638	eyebrows met, his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the
  1639	range of his vision, and he looked as if he magnified the objects
  1640	lessened by distance, as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque
  1641	to our eyes, and as if he read the very depths of the seas.
  1642	
  1643	The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and
  1644	shod with sea boots of seal's skin, were dressed in clothes of a
  1645	particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs.  The
  1646	taller of the two, evidently the chief on board, examined us with great
  1647	attention, without saying a word; then, turning to his companion,
  1648	talked with him in an unknown tongue.  It was a sonorous, harmonious,
  1649	and flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied
  1650	accentuation.
  1651	
  1652	The other replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three
  1653	perfectly incomprehensible words.  Then he seemed to question me by a
  1654	look.
  1655	
  1656	I replied in good French that I did not know his language; but he
  1657	seemed not to understand me, and my situation became more embarrassing.
  1658	
  1659	"If master were to tell our story," said Conseil, "perhaps these
  1660	gentlemen may understand some words."
  1661	
  1662	I began to tell our adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and
  1663	without omitting one single detail.  I announced our names and rank,
  1664	introducing in person Professor Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and
  1665	master Ned Land, the harpooner.
  1666	
  1667	The man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly, even politely,
  1668	and with extreme attention; but nothing in his countenance indicated
  1669	that he had understood my story.  When I finished, he said not a word.
  1670	
  1671	There remained one resource, to speak English.  Perhaps they would know
  1672	this almost universal language.  I knew it--as well as the German
  1673	language--well enough to read it fluently, but not to speak it
  1674	correctly.  But, anyhow, we must make ourselves understood.
  1675	
  1676	"Go on in your turn," I said to the harpooner; "speak your best
  1677	Anglo-Saxon, and try to do better than I."
  1678	
  1679	Ned did not beg off, and recommenced our story.
  1680	
  1681	To his great disgust, the harpooner did not seem to have made himself
  1682	more intelligible than I had.  Our visitors did not stir.  They
  1683	evidently understood neither the language of England nor of France.
  1684	
  1685	Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted our speaking
  1686	resources, I knew not what part to take, when Conseil said:
  1687	
  1688	"If master will permit me, I will relate it in German."
  1689	
  1690	But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the
  1691	German language had no success.  At last, nonplussed, I tried to
  1692	remember my first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but
  1693	with no better success.  This last attempt being of no avail, the two
  1694	strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language, and retired.
  1695	
  1696	The door shut.
  1697	
  1698	"It is an infamous shame," cried Ned Land, who broke out for the
  1699	twentieth time.  "We speak to those rogues in French, English, German,
  1700	and Latin, and not one of them has the politeness to answer!"
  1701	
  1702	"Calm yourself," I said to the impetuous Ned; "anger will do no good."
  1703	
  1704	"But do you see, Professor," replied our irascible companion, "that we
  1705	shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?"
  1706	
  1707	"Bah!" said Conseil, philosophically; "we can hold out some time yet."
  1708	
  1709	"My friends," I said, "we must not despair.  We have been worse off
  1710	than this.  Do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion
  1711	upon the commander and crew of this boat."
  1712	
  1713	"My opinion is formed," replied Ned Land, sharply.  "They are rascals."
  1714	
  1715	"Good! and from what country?"
  1716	
  1717	"From the land of rogues!"
  1718	
  1719	"My brave Ned, that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the
  1720	world; but I admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to
  1721	determine.  Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain.
  1722	However, I am inclined to think that the commander and his companion
  1723	were born in low latitudes.  There is southern blood in them.  But I
  1724	cannot decide by their appearance whether they are Spaniards, Turks,
  1725	Arabians, or Indians.  As to their language, it is quite
  1726	incomprehensible."
  1727	
  1728	"There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages," said Conseil,
  1729	"or the disadvantage of not having one universal language."
  1730	
  1731	As he said these words, the door opened.  A steward entered.  He
  1732	brought us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff I did not know.
  1733	I hastened to dress myself, and my companions followed my example.
  1734	During that time, the steward--dumb, perhaps deaf--had arranged the
  1735	table, and laid three plates.
  1736	
  1737	"This is something like!" said Conseil.
  1738	
  1739	"Bah!" said the angry harpooner, "what do you suppose they eat here?
  1740	Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beef steaks from seadogs."
  1741	
  1742	"We shall see," said Conseil.
  1743	
  1744	The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our
  1745	places.  Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it
  1746	not been for the electric light which flooded us, I could have fancied
  1747	I was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the
  1748	Grand Hotel in Paris.  I must say, however, that there was neither
  1749	bread nor wine.  The water was fresh and clear, but it was water and
  1750	did not suit Ned Land's taste.  Amongst the dishes which were brought
  1751	to us, I recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of some,
  1752	although excellent, I could give no opinion, neither could I tell to
  1753	what kingdom they belonged, whether animal or vegetable.  As to the
  1754	dinner-service, it was elegant, and in perfect taste.  Each
  1755	utensil--spoon, fork, knife, plate--had a letter engraved on it, with a
  1756	motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile:
  1757	
  1758	
  1759	MOBILIS IN MOBILI N
  1760	
  1761	The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical
  1762	person who commanded at the bottom of the seas.
  1763	
  1764	Ned and Conseil did not reflect much.  They devoured the food, and I
  1765	did likewise.  I was, besides, reassured as to our fate; and it seemed
  1766	evident that our hosts would not let us die of want.
  1767	
  1768	However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger
  1769	of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours.  Our appetites
  1770	satisfied, we felt overcome with sleep.
  1771	
  1772	"Faith!  I shall sleep well," said Conseil.
  1773	
  1774	"So shall I," replied Ned Land.
  1775	
  1776	My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were
  1777	soon sound asleep.  For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my
  1778	brain, too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies
  1779	kept my eyes half open.  Where were we?  What strange power carried us
  1780	on?  I felt--or rather fancied I felt--the machine sinking down to the
  1781	lowest beds of the sea.  Dreadful nightmares beset me; I saw in these
  1782	mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this
  1783	submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and
  1784	formidable as they.  Then my brain grew calmer, my imagination wandered
  1785	into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a deep sleep.
  1786	
  1787	
  1788	
  1789	CHAPTER IX
  1790	
  1791	NED LAND'S TEMPERS
  1792	
  1793	How long we slept I do not know; but our sleep must have lasted long,
  1794	for it rested us completely from our fatigues.  I woke first.  My
  1795	companions had not moved, and were still stretched in their corner.
  1796	
  1797	Hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch, I felt my brain freed, my
  1798	mind clear.  I then began an attentive examination of our cell.
  1799	Nothing was changed inside.  The prison was still a prison--the
  1800	prisoners, prisoners.  However, the steward, during our sleep, had
  1801	cleared the table.  I breathed with difficulty.  The heavy air seemed
  1802	to oppress my lungs.  Although the cell was large, we had evidently
  1803	consumed a great part of the oxygen that it contained.  Indeed, each
  1804	man consumes, in one hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints
  1805	of air, and this air, charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of
  1806	carbonic acid, becomes unbreathable.
  1807	
  1808	It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison, and no doubt
  1809	the whole in the submarine boat.  That gave rise to a question in my
  1810	mind.  How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed?
  1811	Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen
  1812	contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by
  1813	caustic potash?  Or--a more convenient, economical, and consequently
  1814	more probable alternative--would he be satisfied to rise and take
  1815	breath at the surface of the water, like a whale, and so renew for
  1816	twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?
  1817	
  1818	In fact, I was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out
  1819	of this cell the little oxygen it contained, when suddenly I was
  1820	refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline
  1821	emanations.  It was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine.  I
  1822	opened my mouth wide, and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh
  1823	particles.
  1824	
  1825	At the same time I felt the boat rolling.  The iron-plated monster had
  1826	evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the
  1827	fashion of whales.  I found out from that the mode of ventilating the
  1828	boat.
  1829	
  1830	When I had inhaled this air freely, I sought the conduit pipe, which
  1831	conveyed to us the beneficial whiff, and I was not long in finding it.
  1832	Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air
  1833	renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell.
  1834	
  1835	I was making my observations, when Ned and Conseil awoke almost at the
  1836	same time, under the influence of this reviving air.  They rubbed their
  1837	eyes, stretched themselves, and were on their feet in an instant.
  1838	
  1839	"Did master sleep well?" asked Conseil, with his usual politeness.
  1840	
  1841	"Very well, my brave boy.  And you, Mr. Land?"
  1842	
  1843	"Soundly, Professor.  But, I don't know if I am right or not, there
  1844	seems to be a sea breeze!"
  1845	
  1846	A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had
  1847	passed during his sleep.
  1848	
  1849	"Good!" said he.  "That accounts for those roarings we heard, when the
  1850	supposed narwhal sighted the Abraham Lincoln."
  1851	
  1852	"Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath."
  1853	
  1854	"Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o'clock it is, unless it is
  1855	dinner-time."
  1856	
  1857	"Dinner-time! my good fellow?  Say rather breakfast-time, for we
  1858	certainly have begun another day."
  1859	
  1860	"So," said Conseil, "we have slept twenty-four hours?"
  1861	
  1862	"That is my opinion."
  1863	
  1864	"I will not contradict you," replied Ned Land.  "But, dinner or
  1865	breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings."
  1866	
  1867	"Master Land, we must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose our
  1868	appetites are in advance of the dinner hour."
  1869	
  1870	"That is just like you, friend Conseil," said Ned, impatiently.  "You
  1871	are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before
  1872	grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!"
  1873	
  1874	Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the
  1875	steward did not appear.  It was rather too long to leave us, if they
  1876	really had good intentions towards us.  Ned Land, tormented by the
  1877	cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding his
  1878	promise, I dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the
  1879	crew.
  1880	
  1881	For two hours more Ned Land's temper increased; he cried, he shouted,
  1882	but in vain.  The walls were deaf.  There was no sound to be heard in
  1883	the boat; all was still as death.  It did not move, for I should have
  1884	felt the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw.
  1885	Plunged in the depths of the waters, it belonged no longer to earth:
  1886	this silence was dreadful.
  1887	
  1888	I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared.
  1889	
  1890	Just then a noise was heard outside.  Steps sounded on the metal flags.
  1891	The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared.
  1892	
  1893	Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him
  1894	down, and held him by the throat.  The steward was choking under the
  1895	grip of his powerful hand.
  1896	
  1897	Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner's hand from his
  1898	half-suffocated victim, and I was going to fly to the rescue, when
  1899	suddenly I was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French:
  1900	
  1901	"Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to
  1902	listen to me?"
  1903	
  1904	
  1905	
  1906	CHAPTER X
  1907	
  1908	THE MAN OF THE SEAS
  1909	
  1910	It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.
  1911	
  1912	At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly.  The steward, nearly strangled,
  1913	tottered out on a sign from his master.  But such was the power of the
  1914	commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which
  1915	this man must have felt towards the Canadian.  Conseil interested in
  1916	spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this
  1917	scene.
  1918	
  1919	The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms
  1920	folded, scanned us with profound attention.  Did he hesitate to speak?
  1921	Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French?  One might
  1922	almost think so.
  1923	
  1924	After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,
  1925	"Gentlemen," said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, "I speak French,
  1926	English, German, and Latin equally well.  I could, therefore, have
  1927	answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,
  1928	then to reflect.  The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the
  1929	main points, convinced me of your identity.  I know now that chance has
  1930	brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at
  1931	the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,
  1932	Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on
  1933	board the frigate Abraham Lincoln of the navy of the United States of
  1934	America."
  1935	
  1936	I bowed assent.  It was not a question that the commander put to me.
  1937	Therefore there was no answer to be made.  This man expressed himself
  1938	with perfect ease, without any accent.  His sentences were well turned,
  1939	his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable.  Yet, I did not
  1940	recognise in him a fellow-countryman.
  1941	
  1942	He continued the conversation in these terms:
  1943	
  1944	"You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying
  1945	you this second visit.  The reason is that, your identity recognised, I
  1946	wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you.  I have
  1947	hesitated much.  Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the
  1948	presence of a man who has broken all the ties of humanity.  You have
  1949	come to trouble my existence."
  1950	
  1951	"Unintentionally!" said I.
  1952	
  1953	"Unintentionally?" replied the stranger, raising his voice a little.
  1954	"Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln pursued me all over
  1955	the seas?  Was it unintentionally that you took passage in this
  1956	frigate?  Was it unintentionally that your cannon-balls rebounded off
  1957	the plating of my vessel?  Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land
  1958	struck me with his harpoon?"
  1959	
  1960	I detected a restrained irritation in these words.  But to these
  1961	recriminations I had a very natural answer to make, and I made it.
  1962	
  1963	"Sir," said I, "no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have
  1964	taken place concerning you in America and Europe.  You do not know that
  1965	divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,
  1966	have excited public feeling in the two continents.  I omit the theories
  1967	without number by which it was sought to explain that of which you
  1968	alone possess the secret.  But you must understand that, in pursuing
  1969	you over the high seas of the Pacific, the Abraham Lincoln believed
  1970	itself to be chasing some powerful sea-monster, of which it was
  1971	necessary to rid the ocean at any price."
  1972	
  1973	A half-smile curled the lips of the commander:  then, in a calmer tone:
  1974	
  1975	"M. Aronnax," he replied, "dare you affirm that your frigate would not
  1976	as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?"
  1977	
  1978	This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not
  1979	have hesitated.  He might have thought it his duty to destroy a
  1980	contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.
  1981	
  1982	"You understand then, sir," continued the stranger, "that I have the
  1983	right to treat you as enemies?"
  1984	
  1985	I answered nothing, purposely.  For what good would it be to discuss
  1986	such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?
  1987	
  1988	"I have hesitated some time," continued the commander; "nothing obliged
  1989	me to show you hospitality.  If I chose to separate myself from you, I
  1990	should have no interest in seeing you again; I could place you upon the
  1991	deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge, I could sink
  1992	beneath the waters, and forget that you had ever existed.  Would not
  1993	that be my right?"
  1994	
  1995	"It might be the right of a savage," I answered, "but not that of a
  1996	civilised man."
  1997	
  1998	"Professor," replied the commander, quickly, "I am not what you call a
  1999	civilised man!  I have done with society entirely, for reasons which I
  2000	alone have the right of appreciating.  I do not, therefore, obey its
  2001	laws, and I desire you never to allude to them before me again!"
  2002	
  2003	This was said plainly.  A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the
  2004	eyes of the Unknown, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life
  2005	of this man.  Not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human
  2006	laws, but he had made himself independent of them, free in the
  2007	strictest acceptation of the word, quite beyond their reach!  Who then
  2008	would dare to pursue him at the bottom of the sea, when, on its
  2009	surface, he defied all attempts made against him?
  2010	
  2011	What vessel could resist the shock of his submarine monitor?  What
  2012	cuirass, however thick, could withstand the blows of his spur?  No man
  2013	could demand from him an account of his actions; God, if he believed in
  2014	one--his conscience, if he had one--were the sole judges to whom he was
  2015	answerable.
  2016	
  2017	These reflections crossed my mind rapidly, whilst the stranger
  2018	personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself.  I
  2019	regarded him with fear mingled with interest, as, doubtless, OEdiphus
  2020	regarded the Sphinx.
  2021	
  2022	After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.
  2023	
  2024	"I have hesitated," said he, "but I have thought that my interest might
  2025	be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right.
  2026	You will remain on board my vessel, since fate has cast you there.  You
  2027	will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, I shall only impose
  2028	one single condition.  Your word of honour to submit to it will
  2029	suffice."
  2030	
  2031	"Speak, sir," I answered.  "I suppose this condition is one which a man
  2032	of honour may accept?"
  2033	
  2034	"Yes, sir; it is this:  It is possible that certain events, unforeseen,
  2035	may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some
  2036	days, as the case may be.  As I desire never to use violence, I expect
  2037	from you, more than all the others, a passive obedience.  In thus
  2038	acting, I take all the responsibility:  I acquit you entirely, for I
  2039	make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen.  Do
  2040	you accept this condition?"
  2041	
  2042	Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular,
  2043	and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the
  2044	pale of social laws.  Amongst the surprises which the future was
  2045	preparing for me, this might not be the least.
  2046	
  2047	"We accept," I answered; "only I will ask your permission, sir, to
  2048	address one question to you--one only."
  2049	
  2050	"Speak, sir."
  2051	
  2052	"You said that we should be free on board."
  2053	
  2054	"Entirely."
  2055	
  2056	"I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?"
  2057	
  2058	"Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that
  2059	passes here save under rare circumstances--the liberty, in short, which
  2060	we enjoy ourselves, my companions and I."
  2061	
  2062	It was evident that we did not understand one another.
  2063	
  2064	"Pardon me, sir," I resumed, "but this liberty is only what every
  2065	prisoner has of pacing his prison.  It cannot suffice us."
  2066	
  2067	"It must suffice you, however."
  2068	
  2069	"What! we must renounce for ever seeing our country, our friends, our
  2070	relations again?"
  2071	
  2072	"Yes, sir.  But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men
  2073	believe to be liberty is not perhaps so painful as you think."
  2074	
  2075	"Well," exclaimed Ned Land, "never will I give my word of honour not to
  2076	try to escape."
  2077	
  2078	"I did not ask you for your word of honour, Master Land," answered the
  2079	commander, coldly.
  2080	
  2081	"Sir," I replied, beginning to get angry in spite of my self, "you
  2082	abuse your situation towards us; it is cruelty."
  2083	
  2084	"No, sir, it is clemency.  You are my prisoners of war.  I keep you,
  2085	when I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean.  You
  2086	attacked me.  You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world
  2087	must penetrate--the secret of my whole existence.  And you think that I
  2088	am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?
  2089	Never!  In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard--it is myself."
  2090	
  2091	These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander,
  2092	against which no arguments would prevail.
  2093	
  2094	"So, sir," I rejoined, "you give us simply the choice between life and
  2095	death?"
  2096	
  2097	"Simply."
  2098	
  2099	"My friends," said I, "to a question thus put, there is nothing to
  2100	answer.  But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel."
  2101	
  2102	"None, sir," answered the Unknown.
  2103	
  2104	Then, in a gentler tone, he continued:
  2105	
  2106	"Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you.  I know you, M.
  2107	Aronnax.  You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to
  2108	complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate.  You will
  2109	find amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you
  2110	have published on `the depths of the sea.'  I have often read it.  You
  2111	have carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you.
  2112	But you do not know all--you have not seen all.  Let me tell you then,
  2113	Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.
  2114	You are going to visit the land of marvels."
  2115	
  2116	These words of the commander had a great effect upon me.  I cannot deny
  2117	it.  My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the
  2118	contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of
  2119	liberty.  Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave
  2120	question.  So I contented myself with saying:
  2121	
  2122	"By what name ought I to address you?"
  2123	
  2124	"Sir," replied the commander, "I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;
  2125	and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the
  2126	Nautilus."
  2127	
  2128	Captain Nemo called.  A steward appeared.  The captain gave him his
  2129	orders in that strange language which I did not understand.  Then,
  2130	turning towards the Canadian and Conseil:
  2131	
  2132	"A repast awaits you in your cabin," said he.  "Be so good as to follow
  2133	this man.
  2134	
  2135	"And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready.  Permit me to lead the
  2136	way."
  2137	
  2138	"I am at your service, Captain."
  2139	
  2140	I followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as I had passed through the door,
  2141	I found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to
  2142	the waist of a ship.  After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second
  2143	door opened before me.
  2144	
  2145	I then entered a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste.
  2146	High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities
  2147	of the room, and upon their shelves glittered china, porcelain, and
  2148	glass of inestimable value.  The plate on the table sparkled in the
  2149	rays which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was
  2150	tempered and softened by exquisite paintings.
  2151	
  2152	In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out.  Captain Nemo
  2153	indicated the place I was to occupy.
  2154	
  2155	The breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes, the contents of
  2156	which were furnished by the sea alone; and I was ignorant of the nature
  2157	and mode of preparation of some of them.  I acknowledged that they were
  2158	good, but they had a peculiar flavour, which I easily became accustomed
  2159	to.  These different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus,
  2160	and I thought they must have a marine origin.
  2161	
  2162	Captain Nemo looked at me.  I asked him no questions, but he guessed my
  2163	thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was
  2164	burning to address to him.
  2165	
  2166	"The greater part of these dishes are unknown to you," he said to me.
  2167	"However, you may partake of them without fear.  They are wholesome and
  2168	nourishing.  For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth,
  2169	and I am never ill now.  My crew, who are healthy, are fed on the same
  2170	food."
  2171	
  2172	"So," said I, "all these eatables are the produce of the sea?"
  2173	
  2174	"Yes, Professor, the sea supplies all my wants.  Sometimes I cast my
  2175	nets in tow, and I draw them in ready to break.  Sometimes I hunt in
  2176	the midst of this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man, and
  2177	quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests.  My flocks, like
  2178	those of Neptune's old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense
  2179	prairies of the ocean.  I have a vast property there, which I cultivate
  2180	myself, and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all
  2181	things."
  2182	
  2183	"I can understand perfectly, sir, that your nets furnish excellent fish
  2184	for your table; I can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in
  2185	your submarine forests; but I cannot understand at all how a particle
  2186	of meat, no matter how small, can figure in your bill of fare."
  2187	
  2188	"This, which you believe to be meat, Professor, is nothing else than
  2189	fillet of turtle.  Here are also some dolphins' livers, which you take
  2190	to be ragout of pork.  My cook is a clever fellow, who excels in
  2191	dressing these various products of the ocean.  Taste all these dishes.
  2192	Here is a preserve of sea-cucumber, which a Malay would declare to be
  2193	unrivalled in the world; here is a cream, of which the milk has been
  2194	furnished by the cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North
  2195	Sea; and, lastly, permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones,
  2196	which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits."
  2197	
  2198	I tasted, more from curiosity than as a connoisseur, whilst Captain
  2199	Nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories.
  2200	
  2201	"You like the sea, Captain?"
  2202	
  2203	"Yes; I love it!  The sea is everything.  It covers seven tenths of the
  2204	terrestrial globe.  Its breath is pure and healthy.  It is an immense
  2205	desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all
  2206	sides.  The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful
  2207	existence.  It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the `Living
  2208	Infinite,' as one of your poets has said.  In fact, Professor, Nature
  2209	manifests herself in it by her three kingdoms--mineral, vegetable, and
  2210	animal.  The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature.  The globe began with
  2211	sea, so to speak; and who knows if it will not end with it?  In it is
  2212	supreme tranquillity.  The sea does not belong to despots.  Upon its
  2213	surface men can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to
  2214	pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors.  But at thirty
  2215	feet below its level, their reign ceases, their influence is quenched,
  2216	and their power disappears.  Ah! sir, live--live in the bosom of the
  2217	waters!  There only is independence!  There I recognise no masters!
  2218	There I am free!"
  2219	
  2220	Captain Nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm, by
  2221	which he was quite carried away.  For a few moments he paced up and
  2222	down, much agitated.  Then he became more calm, regained his accustomed
  2223	coldness of expression, and turning towards me:
  2224	
  2225	"Now, Professor," said he, "if you wish to go over the Nautilus, I am
  2226	at your service."
  2227	
  2228	Captain Nemo rose.  I followed him.  A double door, contrived at the
  2229	back of the dining-room, opened, and I entered a room equal in
  2230	dimensions to that which I had just quitted.
  2231	
  2232	It was a library.  High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony
  2233	inlaid with brass, supported upon their wide shelves a great number of
  2234	books uniformly bound.  They followed the shape of the room,
  2235	terminating at the lower part in huge divans, covered with brown
  2236	leather, which were curved, to afford the greatest comfort.  Light
  2237	movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, allowed one to rest
  2238	one's book while reading.  In the centre stood an immense table,
  2239	covered with pamphlets, amongst which were some newspapers, already of
  2240	old date.  The electric light flooded everything; it was shed from four
  2241	unpolished globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling.  I looked
  2242	with real admiration at this room, so ingeniously fitted up, and I
  2243	could scarcely believe my eyes.
  2244	
  2245	"Captain Nemo," said I to my host, who had just thrown himself on one
  2246	of the divans, "this is a library which would do honour to more than
  2247	one of the continental palaces, and I am absolutely astounded when I
  2248	consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas."
  2249	
  2250	"Where could one find greater solitude or silence, Professor?" replied
  2251	Captain Nemo.  "Did your study in the Museum afford you such perfect
  2252	quiet?"
  2253	
  2254	"No, sir; and I must confess that it is a very poor one after yours.
  2255	You must have six or seven thousand volumes here."
  2256	
  2257	"Twelve thousand, M. Aronnax.  These are the only ties which bind me to
  2258	the earth.  But I had done with the world on the day when my Nautilus
  2259	plunged for the first time beneath the waters.  That day I bought my
  2260	last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers, and from that time I
  2261	wish to think that men no longer think or write.  These books,
  2262	Professor, are at your service besides, and you can make use of them
  2263	freely."
  2264	
  2265	I thanked Captain Nemo, and went up to the shelves of the library.
  2266	Works on science, morals, and literature abounded in every language;
  2267	but I did not see one single work on political economy; that subject
  2268	appeared to be strictly proscribed.  Strange to say, all these books
  2269	were irregularly arranged, in whatever language they were written; and
  2270	this medley proved that the Captain of the Nautilus must have read
  2271	indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance.
  2272	
  2273	"Sir," said I to the Captain, "I thank you for having placed this
  2274	library at my disposal.  It contains treasures of science, and I shall
  2275	profit by them."
  2276	
  2277	"This room is not only a library," said Captain Nemo, "it is also a
  2278	smoking-room."
  2279	
  2280	"A smoking-room!" I cried.  "Then one may smoke on board?"
  2281	
  2282	"Certainly."
  2283	
  2284	"Then, sir, I am forced to believe that you have kept up a
  2285	communication with Havannah."
  2286	
  2287	"Not any," answered the Captain.  "Accept this cigar, M. Aronnax; and,
  2288	though it does not come from Havannah, you will be pleased with it, if
  2289	you are a connoisseur."
  2290	
  2291	I took the cigar which was offered me; its shape recalled the London
  2292	ones, but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold.  I lighted it at a
  2293	little brazier, which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem, and
  2294	drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has
  2295	not smoked for two days.
  2296	
  2297	"It is excellent, but it is not tobacco."
  2298	
  2299	"No!" answered the Captain, "this tobacco comes neither from Havannah
  2300	nor from the East.  It is a kind of sea-weed, rich in nicotine, with
  2301	which the sea provides me, but somewhat sparingly."
  2302	
  2303	At that moment Captain Nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that
  2304	by which I had entered the library, and I passed into an immense
  2305	drawing-room splendidly lighted.
  2306	
  2307	It was a vast, four-sided room, thirty feet long, eighteen wide, and
  2308	fifteen high.  A luminous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques,
  2309	shed a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this
  2310	museum.  For it was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and
  2311	prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with
  2312	the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painter's studio.
  2313	
  2314	Thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright
  2315	drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe
  2316	design. I saw works of great value, the greater part of which I had
  2317	admired in the special collections of Europe, and in the exhibitions of
  2318	paintings. The several schools of the old masters were represented by a
  2319	Madonna of Raphael, a Virgin of Leonardo da Vinci, a nymph of Corregio,
  2320	a woman of Titan, an Adoration of Veronese, an Assumption of Murillo, a
  2321	portrait of Holbein, a monk of Velasquez, a martyr of Ribera, a fair of
  2322	Rubens, two Flemish landscapes of Teniers, three little "genre"
  2323	pictures of Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two specimens of
  2324	Gericault and Prudhon, and some sea-pieces of Backhuysen and Vernet.
  2325	Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures
  2326	of Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc.; and
  2327	some admirable statues in marble and bronze, after the finest antique
  2328	models, stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum.
  2329	Amazement, as the Captain of the Nautilus had predicted, had already
  2330	begun to take possession of me.
  2331	
  2332	"Professor," said this strange man, "you must excuse the unceremonious
  2333	way in which I receive you, and the disorder of this room."
  2334	
  2335	"Sir," I answered, "without seeking to know who you are, I recognise in
  2336	you an artist."
  2337	
  2338	"An amateur, nothing more, sir.  Formerly I loved to collect these
  2339	beautiful works created by the hand of man.  I sought them greedily,
  2340	and ferreted them out indefatigably, and I have been able to bring
  2341	together some objects of great value.  These are my last souvenirs of
  2342	that world which is dead to me.  In my eyes, your modern artists are
  2343	already old; they have two or three thousand years of existence; I
  2344	confound them in my own mind.  Masters have no age."
  2345	
  2346	"And these musicians?" said I, pointing out some works of Weber,
  2347	Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Herold, Wagner, Auber,
  2348	Gounod, and a number of others, scattered over a large model
  2349	piano-organ which occupied one of the panels of the drawing-room.
  2350	
  2351	"These musicians," replied Captain Nemo, "are the contemporaries of
  2352	Orpheus; for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences
  2353	are effaced; and I am dead, Professor; as much dead as those of your
  2354	friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth!"
  2355	
  2356	Captain Nemo was silent, and seemed lost in a profound reverie. I
  2357	contemplated him with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange
  2358	expression of his countenance. Leaning on his elbow against an angle of
  2359	a costly mosaic table, he no longer saw me,--he had forgotten my
  2360	presence.
  2361	
  2362	I did not disturb this reverie, and continued my observation of the
  2363	curiosities which enriched this drawing-room.
  2364	
  2365	Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and
  2366	labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been
  2367	presented to the eye of a naturalist.  My delight as a professor may be
  2368	conceived.
  2369	
  2370	The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious
  2371	specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first
  2372	group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges
  2373	of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of
  2374	the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairae, alcyonariae, a whole
  2375	series of madrepores, which my master Milne Edwards has so cleverly
  2376	classified, amongst which I remarked some wonderful flabellinae
  2377	oculinae of the Island of Bourbon, the "Neptune's car" of the Antilles,
  2378	superb varieties of corals--in short, every species of those curious
  2379	polypi of which entire islands are formed, which will one day become
  2380	continents. Of the echinodermes, remarkable for their coating of
  2381	spines, asteri, sea-stars, pantacrinae, comatules, asterophons, echini,
  2382	holothuri, etc., represented individually a complete collection of this
  2383	group.
  2384	
  2385	A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before
  2386	other more numerous cases, in which were classified the specimens of
  2387	molluscs. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails me
  2388	to describe minutely. Amongst these specimens I will quote from memory
  2389	only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular
  2390	white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial
  2391	spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in
  2392	the European museums--(I estimated its value at not less than L1000); a
  2393	common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured
  2394	with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve
  2395	shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several
  2396	varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged
  2397	with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of
  2398	trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a
  2399	reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; others from the Gulf of
  2400	Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell; stellari found in the
  2401	Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New
  2402	Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which
  2403	science has given appropriate names.
  2404	
  2405	Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of pearls of
  2406	the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little
  2407	sparks of fire; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea;
  2408	green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the
  2409	curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain
  2410	mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of
  2411	inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines.
  2412	Some of these pearls were larger than a pigeon's egg, and were worth as
  2413	much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah
  2414	of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession
  2415	of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the
  2416	world.
  2417	
  2418	Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply
  2419	impossible.  Captain Nemo must have expended millions in the
  2420	acquirement of these various specimens, and I was thinking what source
  2421	he could have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify his fancy
  2422	for collecting, when I was interrupted by these words:
  2423	
  2424	"You are examining my shells, Professor?  Unquestionably they must be
  2425	interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm,
  2426	for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea
  2427	on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches."
  2428	
  2429	"I can understand, Captain, the delight of wandering about in the midst
  2430	of such riches.  You are one of those who have collected their
  2431	treasures themselves.  No museum in Europe possesses such a collection
  2432	of the produce of the ocean.  But if I exhaust all my admiration upon
  2433	it, I shall have none left for the vessel which carries it.  I do not
  2434	wish to pry into your secrets:  but I must confess that this Nautilus,
  2435	with the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which
  2436	enable it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite
  2437	my curiosity to the highest pitch.  I see suspended on the walls of
  2438	this room instruments of whose use I am ignorant."
  2439	
  2440	"You will find these same instruments in my own room, Professor, where
  2441	I shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you.  But first
  2442	come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use.  You
  2443	must see how you will be accommodated on board the Nautilus."
  2444	
  2445	I followed Captain Nemo who, by one of the doors opening from each
  2446	panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist.  He conducted me towards
  2447	the bow, and there I found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a
  2448	bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of excellent furniture.
  2449	
  2450	I could only thank my host.
  2451	
  2452	"Your room adjoins mine," said he, opening a door, "and mine opens into
  2453	the drawing-room that we have just quitted."
  2454	
  2455	I entered the Captain's room:  it had a severe, almost a monkish
  2456	aspect.  A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet;
  2457	the whole lighted by a skylight.  No comforts, the strictest
  2458	necessaries only.
  2459	
  2460	Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.
  2461	
  2462	"Be so good as to sit down," he said.  I seated myself, and he began
  2463	thus:
  2464	
  2465	
  2466	
  2467	CHAPTER XI
  2468	
  2469	ALL BY ELECTRICITY
  2470	
  2471	"Sir," said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments hanging on the
  2472	walls of his room, "here are the contrivances required for the
  2473	navigation of the Nautilus.  Here, as in the drawing-room, I have them
  2474	always under my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact direction
  2475	in the middle of the ocean.  Some are known to you, such as the
  2476	thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the Nautilus; the
  2477	barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the
  2478	changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the
  2479	atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing,
  2480	announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides my course;
  2481	the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun;
  2482	chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses for day
  2483	and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon, when the
  2484	Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves."
  2485	
  2486	"These are the usual nautical instruments," I replied, "and I know the
  2487	use of them.  But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular
  2488	requirements of the Nautilus.  This dial with movable needle is a
  2489	manometer, is it not?"
  2490	
  2491	"It is actually a manometer.  But by communication with the water,
  2492	whose external pressure it indicates, it gives our depth at the same
  2493	time."
  2494	
  2495	"And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?"
  2496	
  2497	"Here, Professor, I ought to give you some explanations.  Will you be
  2498	kind enough to listen to me?"
  2499	
  2500	He was silent for a few moments, then he said:
  2501	
  2502	"There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to
  2503	every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel.  Everything is done
  2504	by means of it.  It lights, warms it, and is the soul of my mechanical
  2505	apparatus.  This agent is electricity."
  2506	
  2507	"Electricity?"  I cried in surprise.
  2508	
  2509	"Yes, sir."
  2510	
  2511	"Nevertheless, Captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of movement,
  2512	which does not agree well with the power of electricity.  Until now,
  2513	its dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able
  2514	to produce a small amount of power."
  2515	
  2516	"Professor," said Captain Nemo, "my electricity is not everybody's.
  2517	You know what sea-water is composed of.  In a thousand grammes are
  2518	found 96 1/2 per cent. of water, and about 2 2/3 per cent.  of chloride
  2519	of sodium; then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of
  2520	potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and
  2521	carbonate of lime.  You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a
  2522	large part of it.  So it is this sodium that I extract from the
  2523	sea-water, and of which I compose my ingredients.  I owe all to the
  2524	ocean; it produces electricity, and electricity gives heat, light,
  2525	motion, and, in a word, life to the Nautilus."
  2526	
  2527	"But not the air you breathe?"
  2528	
  2529	"Oh!  I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it
  2530	is useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.
  2531	However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it
  2532	works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious
  2533	reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I
  2534	will, my stay in the depths of the sea.  It gives a uniform and
  2535	unintermittent light, which the sun does not.  Now look at this clock;
  2536	it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best
  2537	chronometers.  I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the
  2538	Italian clocks, because for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor
  2539	moon, but only that factitious light that I take with me to the bottom
  2540	of the sea.  Look! just now, it is ten o'clock in the morning."
  2541	
  2542	"Exactly."
  2543	
  2544	"Another application of electricity.  This dial hanging in front of us
  2545	indicates the speed of the Nautilus.  An electric thread puts it in
  2546	communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.
  2547	Look! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles
  2548	an hour."
  2549	
  2550	"It is marvelous!  And I see, Captain, you were right to make use of
  2551	this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam."
  2552	
  2553	"We have not finished, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo, rising.  "If you
  2554	will allow me, we will examine the stern of the Nautilus."
  2555	
  2556	Really, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat, of
  2557	which this is the exact division, starting from the ship's head: the
  2558	dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a
  2559	water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large
  2560	drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain's room by a
  2561	second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length;
  2562	mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a
  2563	half yards, that extended to the bows.  Total length thirty five yards,
  2564	or one hundred and five feet.  The partitions had doors that were shut
  2565	hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments, and they ensured the
  2566	safety of the Nautilus in case of a leak.
  2567	
  2568	I followed Captain Nemo through the waist, and arrived at the centre of
  2569	the boat.  There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions.
  2570	An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition, led to the
  2571	upper end.  I asked the Captain what the ladder was used for.
  2572	
  2573	"It leads to the small boat," he said.
  2574	
  2575	"What! have you a boat?"  I exclaimed, in surprise.
  2576	
  2577	"Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves
  2578	either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat."
  2579	
  2580	"But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the
  2581	surface of the water?"
  2582	
  2583	"Not at all.  This boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of
  2584	the Nautilus, and occupies a cavity made for it.  It is decked, quite
  2585	water-tight, and held together by solid bolts.  This ladder leads to a
  2586	man-hole made in the hull of the Nautilus, that corresponds with a
  2587	similar hole made in the side of the boat.  By this double opening I
  2588	get into the small vessel.  They shut the one belonging to the
  2589	Nautilus; I shut the other by means of screw pressure.  I undo the
  2590	bolts, and the little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with
  2591	prodigious rapidity.  I then open the panel of the bridge, carefully
  2592	shut till then; I mast it, hoist my sail, take my oars, and I'm off."
  2593	
  2594	"But how do you get back on board?"
  2595	
  2596	"I do not come back, M. Aronnax; the Nautilus comes to me."
  2597	
  2598	"By your orders?"
  2599	
  2600	"By my orders.  An electric thread connects us.  I telegraph to it, and
  2601	that is enough."
  2602	
  2603	"Really," I said, astonished at these marvels, "nothing can be more
  2604	simple."
  2605	
  2606	After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the
  2607	platform, I saw a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land,
  2608	enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity.  Then a
  2609	door opened into a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large
  2610	store-rooms. There electricity, better than gas itself, did all the
  2611	cooking.  The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of
  2612	platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed.  They also
  2613	heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished
  2614	excellent drinkable water.  Near this kitchen was a bathroom
  2615	comfortably furnished, with hot and cold water taps.
  2616	
  2617	Next to the kitchen was the berth-room of the vessel, sixteen feet
  2618	long.  But the door was shut, and I could not see the management of it,
  2619	which might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on
  2620	board the Nautilus.
  2621	
  2622	At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from
  2623	the engine-room. A door opened, and I found myself in the compartment
  2624	where Captain Nemo--certainly an engineer of a very high order--had
  2625	arranged his locomotive machinery.  This engine-room, clearly lighted,
  2626	did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length.  It was divided
  2627	into two parts; the first contained the materials for producing
  2628	electricity, and the second the machinery that connected it with the
  2629	screw.  I examined it with great interest, in order to understand the
  2630	machinery of the Nautilus.
  2631	
  2632	"You see," said the Captain, "I use Bunsen's contrivances, not
  2633	Ruhmkorff's. Those would not have been powerful enough.  Bunsen's are
  2634	fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be
  2635	the best.  The electricity produced passes forward, where it works, by
  2636	electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels
  2637	that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw.  This one, the
  2638	diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet,
  2639	performs about 120 revolutions in a second."
  2640	
  2641	"And you get then?"
  2642	
  2643	"A speed of fifty miles an hour."
  2644	
  2645	"I have seen the Nautilus manoeuvre before the Abraham Lincoln, and I
  2646	have my own ideas as to its speed.  But this is not enough.  We must
  2647	see where we go.  We must be able to direct it to the right, to the
  2648	left, above, below.  How do you get to the great depths, where you find
  2649	an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres?
  2650	How do you return to the surface of the ocean?  And how do you maintain
  2651	yourselves in the requisite medium?  Am I asking too much?"
  2652	
  2653	"Not at all, Professor," replied the Captain, with some hesitation;
  2654	"since you may never leave this submarine boat.  Come into the saloon,
  2655	it is our usual study, and there you will learn all you want to know
  2656	about the Nautilus."
  2657	
  2658	
  2659	
  2660	CHAPTER XII
  2661	
  2662	SOME FIGURES
  2663	
  2664	A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking.  The
  2665	Captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation
  2666	of the Nautilus.  Then he began his description in these words:
  2667	
  2668	"Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of the boat you are in.
  2669	It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends.  It is very like a cigar
  2670	in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of
  2671	the same sort.  The length of this cylinder, from stem to stern, is
  2672	exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is twenty-six feet.  It is
  2673	not built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but its lines are
  2674	sufficiently long, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the water
  2675	to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage.  These two
  2676	dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and
  2677	cubic contents of the Nautilus.  Its area measures 6,032 feet; and its
  2678	contents about 1,500 cubic yards; that is to say, when completely
  2679	immersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1,500 tons.
  2680	
  2681	"When I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant that
  2682	nine-tenths should be submerged:  consequently it ought only to
  2683	displace nine-tenths of its bulk, that is to say, only to weigh that
  2684	number of tons.  I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded that weight,
  2685	constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.
  2686	
  2687	"The Nautilus is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other outside,
  2688	joined by T-shaped irons, which render it very strong.  Indeed, owing
  2689	to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if it were
  2690	solid.  Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and not by
  2691	the closeness of its rivets; and its perfect union of the materials
  2692	enables it to defy the roughest seas.
  2693	
  2694	"These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7
  2695	to .8 that of water.  The first is not less than two inches and a half
  2696	thick and weighs 394 tons.  The second envelope, the keel, twenty
  2697	inches high and ten thick, weighs only sixty-two tons.  The engine, the
  2698	ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the
  2699	partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons.  Do you follow all this?"
  2700	
  2701	"I do."
  2702	
  2703	"Then, when the Nautilus is afloat under these circumstances, one-tenth
  2704	is out of the water.  Now, if I have made reservoirs of a size equal to
  2705	this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons, and if I fill them with
  2706	water, the boat, weighing then 1,507 tons, will be completely immersed.
  2707	That would happen, Professor.  These reservoirs are in the lower part
  2708	of the Nautilus.  I turn on taps and they fill, and the vessel sinks
  2709	that had just been level with the surface."
  2710	
  2711	"Well, Captain, but now we come to the real difficulty.  I can
  2712	understand your rising to the surface; but, diving below the surface,
  2713	does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and
  2714	consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every
  2715	thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?"
  2716	
  2717	"Just so, sir."
  2718	
  2719	"Then, unless you quite fill the Nautilus, I do not see how you can
  2720	draw it down to those depths."
  2721	
  2722	"Professor, you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be
  2723	exposed to grave errors.  There is very little labour spent in
  2724	attaining the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a
  2725	tendency to sink.  When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of
  2726	weight required to sink the Nautilus, I had only to calculate the
  2727	reduction of volume that sea-water acquires according to the depth."
  2728	
  2729	"That is evident."
  2730	
  2731	"Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable
  2732	of very slight compression.  Indeed, after the most recent calculations
  2733	this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of
  2734	depth.  If we want to sink 3,000 feet, I should keep account of the
  2735	reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water
  2736	of a thousand feet.  The calculation is easily verified.  Now, I have
  2737	supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons.  Therefore
  2738	I can sink to a considerable depth.  When I wish to rise to the level
  2739	of the sea, I only let off the water, and empty all the reservoirs if I
  2740	want the Nautilus to emerge from the tenth part of her total capacity."
  2741	
  2742	I had nothing to object to these reasonings.
  2743	
  2744	"I admit your calculations, Captain," I replied; "I should be wrong to
  2745	dispute them since daily experience confirms them; but I foresee a real
  2746	difficulty in the way."
  2747	
  2748	"What, sir?"
  2749	
  2750	"When you are about 1,000 feet deep, the walls of the Nautilus bear a
  2751	pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If, then, just now you were to empty the
  2752	supplementary reservoirs, to lighten the vessel, and to go up to the
  2753	surface, the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which
  2754	is 1,500 lbs.  per square inch.  From that a power----"
  2755	
  2756	"That electricity alone can give," said the Captain, hastily.  "I
  2757	repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite.
  2758	The pumps of the Nautilus have an enormous power, as you must have
  2759	observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the Abraham
  2760	Lincoln.  Besides, I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a mean
  2761	depth of 750 to 1,000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing my
  2762	machines.  Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean
  2763	five or six mlles below the surface, I make use of slower but not less
  2764	infallible means."
  2765	
  2766	"What are they, Captain?"
  2767	
  2768	"That involves my telling you how the Nautilus is worked."
  2769	
  2770	"I am impatient to learn."
  2771	
  2772	"To steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn, in a word, following
  2773	a horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the
  2774	stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by.  But I can
  2775	also make the Nautilus rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a vertical
  2776	movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its sides,
  2777	opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every direction,
  2778	and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior.  If the
  2779	planes are kept parallel with the boat, it moves horizontally.  If
  2780	slanted, the Nautilus, according to this inclination, and under the
  2781	influence of the screw, either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as
  2782	it suits me.  And even if I wish to rise more quickly to the surface, I
  2783	ship the screw, and the pressure of the water causes the Nautilus to
  2784	rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen."
  2785	
  2786	"Bravo, Captain!  But how can the steersman follow the route in the
  2787	middle of the waters?"
  2788	
  2789	"The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull
  2790	of the Nautilus, and furnished with lenses."
  2791	
  2792	"Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?"
  2793	
  2794	"Perfectly.  Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable
  2795	of offering considerable resistance.  During some experiments of
  2796	fishing by electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates
  2797	less than a third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen
  2798	atmospheres.  Now, the glass that I use is not less than thirty times
  2799	thicker."
  2800	
  2801	"Granted.  But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the
  2802	darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you
  2803	see?"
  2804	
  2805	"Behind the steersman's cage is placed a powerful electric reflector,
  2806	the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front."
  2807	
  2808	"Ah! bravo, bravo, Captain!  Now I can account for this phosphorescence
  2809	in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so.  I now ask you if the
  2810	boarding of the Nautilus and of the Scotia, that has made such a noise,
  2811	has been the result of a chance rencontre?"
  2812	
  2813	"Quite accidental, sir.  I was sailing only one fathom below the
  2814	surface of the water when the shock came.  It had no bad result."
  2815	
  2816	"None, sir.  But now, about your rencontre with the Abraham Lincoln?"
  2817	
  2818	"Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American
  2819	navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself.  I
  2820	contented myself, however, with putting the frigate hors de combat; she
  2821	will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port."
  2822	
  2823	"Ah, Commander! your Nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat."
  2824	
  2825	"Yes, Professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself.  If danger
  2826	threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the
  2827	feeling of an abyss above and below.  On the Nautilus men's hearts
  2828	never fail them.  No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is
  2829	as firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to
  2830	carry away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is
  2831	made of iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the
  2832	only mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep
  2833	water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water it
  2834	reaches absolute tranquillity.  There, sir! that is the perfection of
  2835	vessels!  And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in
  2836	the vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself,
  2837	you understand the trust I repose in my Nautilus; for I am at once
  2838	captain, builder, and engineer."
  2839	
  2840	"But how could you construct this wonderful Nautilus in secret?"
  2841	
  2842	"Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of
  2843	the globe."
  2844	
  2845	"But these parts had to be put together and arranged?"
  2846	
  2847	"Professor, I had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the
  2848	ocean.  There my workmen, that is to say, the brave men that I
  2849	instructed and educated, and myself have put together our Nautilus.
  2850	Then, when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of our
  2851	proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had
  2852	liked."
  2853	
  2854	"Then the cost of this vessel is great?"
  2855	
  2856	"M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs L145 per ton.  Now the Nautilus
  2857	weighed 1,500. It came therefore to L67,500, and L80,000 more for
  2858	fitting it up, and about L200,000, with the works of art and the
  2859	collections it contains."
  2860	
  2861	"One last question, Captain Nemo."
  2862	
  2863	"Ask it, Professor."
  2864	
  2865	"You are rich?"
  2866	
  2867	"Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national
  2868	debt of France."
  2869	
  2870	I stared at the singular person who spoke thus.  Was he playing upon my
  2871	credulity?  The future would decide that.
  2872	
  2873	
  2874	
  2875	CHAPTER XIII
  2876	
  2877	THE BLACK RIVER
  2878	
  2879	The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is
  2880	estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres.  This fluid mass
  2881	comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles,
  2882	forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of
  2883	which would be three quintillions of tons.  To comprehend the meaning
  2884	of these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a
  2885	billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many
  2886	billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion.  This mass
  2887	of fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be
  2888	discharged by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.
  2889	
  2890	During the geological epochs the ocean originally prevailed everywhere.
  2891	Then by degrees, in the silurian period, the tops of the mountains
  2892	began to appear, the islands emerged, then disappeared in partial
  2893	deluges, reappeared, became settled, formed continents, till at length
  2894	the earth became geographically arranged, as we see in the present day.
  2895	The solid had wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred
  2896	and fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billions nine hundred and
  2897	sixty millions of acres.
  2898	
  2899	The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great
  2900	portions:  the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic, or Frozen Ocean,
  2901	the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans.
  2902	
  2903	The Pacific Ocean extends from north to south between the two Polar
  2904	Circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent
  2905	of 145 degrees of longitude.  It is the quietest of seas; its currents
  2906	are broad and slow, it has medium tides, and abundant rain.  Such was
  2907	the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these
  2908	strange conditions.
  2909	
  2910	"Sir," said Captain Nemo, "we will, if you please, take our bearings
  2911	and fix the starting-point of this voyage.  It is a quarter to twelve;
  2912	I will go up again to the surface."
  2913	
  2914	The Captain pressed an electric clock three times.  The pumps began to
  2915	drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a
  2916	different pressure the ascent of the Nautilus, then it stopped.
  2917	
  2918	"We have arrived," said the Captain.
  2919	
  2920	I went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform,
  2921	clambered up the iron steps, and found myself on the upper part of the
  2922	Nautilus.
  2923	
  2924	The platform was only three feet out of water.  The front and back of
  2925	the Nautilus was of that spindle-shape which caused it justly to be
  2926	compared to a cigar.  I noticed that its iron plates, slightly
  2927	overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of
  2928	our large terrestrial reptiles.  It explained to me how natural it was,
  2929	in spite of all glasses, that this boat should have been taken for a
  2930	marine animal.
  2931	
  2932	Toward the middle of the platform the longboat, half buried in the hull
  2933	of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence.  Fore and aft rose two
  2934	cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick
  2935	lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the
  2936	Nautilus, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on the
  2937	road.
  2938	
  2939	The sea was beautiful, the sky pure.  Scarcely could the long vehicle
  2940	feel the broad undulations of the ocean.  A light breeze from the east
  2941	rippled the surface of the waters.  The horizon, free from fog, made
  2942	observation easy.  Nothing was in sight.  Not a quicksand, not an
  2943	island.  A vast desert.
  2944	
  2945	Captain Nemo, by the help of his sextant, took the altitude of the sun,
  2946	which ought also to give the latitude.  He waited for some moments till
  2947	its disc touched the horizon.  Whilst taking observations not a muscle
  2948	moved, the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of
  2949	marble.
  2950	
  2951	"Twelve o'clock, sir," said he.  "When you like----"
  2952	
  2953	I cast a last look upon the sea, slightly yellowed by the Japanese
  2954	coast, and descended to the saloon.
  2955	
  2956	"And now, sir, I leave you to your studies," added the Captain; "our
  2957	course is E.N.E., our depth is twenty-six fathoms.  Here are maps on a
  2958	large scale by which you may follow it.  The saloon is at your
  2959	disposal, and, with your permission, I will retire."  Captain Nemo
  2960	bowed, and I remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on the
  2961	commander of the Nautilus.
  2962	
  2963	For a whole hour was I deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce
  2964	this mystery so interesting to me.  Then my eyes fell upon the vast
  2965	planisphere spread upon the table, and I placed my finger on the very
  2966	spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed.
  2967	
  2968	The sea has its large rivers like the continents.  They are special
  2969	currents known by their temperature and their colour.  The most
  2970	remarkable of these is known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  Science
  2971	has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one
  2972	in the North Atlantic, a second in the South, a third in the North
  2973	Pacific, a fourth in the South, and a fifth in the Southern Indian
  2974	Ocean.  It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or
  2975	another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas
  2976	formed but one vast sheet of water.
  2977	
  2978	At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was
  2979	rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which,
  2980	leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where it is warmed by the perpendicular
  2981	rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast
  2982	of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying
  2983	with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and
  2984	edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water.
  2985	It was this current that the Nautilus was to follow.  I followed it
  2986	with my eye; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the Pacific, and
  2987	felt myself drawn with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the
  2988	door of the saloon.
  2989	
  2990	My two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders
  2991	spread before them.
  2992	
  2993	"Where are we, where are we?" exclaimed the Canadian.  "In the museum
  2994	at Quebec?"
  2995	
  2996	"My friends," I answered, making a sign for them to enter, "you are not
  2997	in Canada, but on board the Nautilus, fifty yards below the level of
  2998	the sea."
  2999	
  3000	"But, M. Aronnax," said Ned Land, "can you tell me how many men there
  3001	are on board?  Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?"
  3002	
  3003	"I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all
  3004	idea of seizing the Nautilus or escaping from it.  This ship is a
  3005	masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen
  3006	it.  Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to
  3007	move amongst such wonders.  So be quiet and let us try and see what
  3008	passes around us."
  3009	
  3010	"See!" exclaimed the harpooner, "but we can see nothing in this iron
  3011	prison!  We are walking--we are sailing--blindly."
  3012	
  3013	Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly
  3014	darkness.  The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes
  3015	received a painful impression.
  3016	
  3017	We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited
  3018	us, whether agreeable or disagreeable.  A sliding noise was heard: one
  3019	would have said that panels were working at the sides of the Nautilus.
  3020	
  3021	"It is the end of the end!" said Ned Land.
  3022	
  3023	Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong
  3024	openings.  The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric
  3025	gleam.  Two crystal plates separated us from the sea.  At first I
  3026	trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but
  3027	strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of
  3028	resistance.
  3029	
  3030	The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the Nautilus.  What
  3031	a spectacle!  What pen can describe it?  Who could paint the effects of
  3032	the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the softness
  3033	of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior strata of
  3034	the ocean?
  3035	
  3036	We know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far
  3037	beyond that of rock-water. The mineral and organic substances which it
  3038	holds in suspension heightens its transparency.  In certain parts of
  3039	the ocean at the Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, can be
  3040	seen with surprising clearness a bed of sand.  The penetrating power of
  3041	the solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and
  3042	fifty fathoms.  But in this middle fluid travelled over by the
  3043	Nautilus, the electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the
  3044	waves.  It was no longer luminous water, but liquid light.
  3045	
  3046	On each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss.  The obscurity
  3047	of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside, and we looked
  3048	out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium.
  3049	
  3050	"You wished to see, friend Ned; well, you see now."
  3051	
  3052	"Curious! curious!" muttered the Canadian, who, forgetting his
  3053	ill-temper, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction; "and one
  3054	would come further than this to admire such a sight!"
  3055	
  3056	"Ah!" thought I to myself, "I understand the life of this man; he has
  3057	made a world apart for himself, in which he treasures all his greatest
  3058	wonders."
  3059	
  3060	For two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  During
  3061	their games, their bounds, while rivalling each other in beauty,
  3062	brightness, and velocity, I distinguished the green labre; the banded
  3063	mullet, marked by a double line of black; the round-tailed goby, of a
  3064	white colour, with violet spots on the back; the Japanese scombrus, a
  3065	beautiful mackerel of these seas, with a blue body and silvery head;
  3066	the brilliant azurors, whose name alone defies description; some banded
  3067	spares, with variegated fins of blue and yellow; the woodcocks of the
  3068	seas, some specimens of which attain a yard in length; Japanese
  3069	salamanders, spider lampreys, serpents six feet long, with eyes small
  3070	and lively, and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; with many other
  3071	species.
  3072	
  3073	Our imagination was kept at its height, interjections followed quickly
  3074	on each other.  Ned named the fish, and Conseil classed them.  I was in
  3075	ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their
  3076	forms.  Never had it been given to me to surprise these animals, alive
  3077	and at liberty, in their natural element.  I will not mention all the
  3078	varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes, all the collection of
  3079	the seas of China and Japan.  These fish, more numerous than the birds
  3080	of the air, came, attracted, no doubt, by the brilliant focus of the
  3081	electric light.
  3082	
  3083	Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon, the iron panels closed
  3084	again, and the enchanting vision disappeared.  But for a long time I
  3085	dreamt on, till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the
  3086	partition.  The compass still showed the course to be E.N.E., the
  3087	manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres, equivalent to a
  3088	depth of twenty five fathoms, and the electric log gave a speed of
  3089	fifteen miles an hour.  I expected Captain Nemo, but he did not appear.
  3090	The clock marked the hour of five.
  3091	
  3092	Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin, and I retired to my
  3093	chamber.  My dinner was ready.  It was composed of turtle soup made of
  3094	the most delicate hawks bills, of a surmullet served with puff paste
  3095	(the liver of which, prepared by itself, was most delicious), and
  3096	fillets of the emperor-holocanthus, the savour of which seemed to me
  3097	superior even to salmon.
  3098	
  3099	I passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking.  Then sleep
  3100	overpowered me, and I stretched myself on my couch of zostera, and
  3101	slept profoundly, whilst the Nautilus was gliding rapidly through the
  3102	current of the Black River.
  3103	
  3104	
  3105	
  3106	CHAPTER XIV
  3107	
  3108	A NOTE OF INVITATION
  3109	
  3110	The next day was the 9th of November.  I awoke after a long sleep of
  3111	twelve hours.  Conseil came, according to custom, to know "how I passed
  3112	the night," and to offer his services.  He had left his friend the
  3113	Canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all his
  3114	life.  I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased, without caring to
  3115	answer him.  I was preoccupied by the absence of the Captain during our
  3116	sitting of the day before, and hoping to see him to-day.
  3117	
  3118	As soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon.  It was deserted.  I
  3119	plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the glasses.
  3120	
  3121	The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from Captain
  3122	Nemo.  The panels of the saloon did not open.  Perhaps they did not
  3123	wish us to tire of these beautiful things.
  3124	
  3125	The course of the Nautilus was E.N.E., her speed twelve knots, the
  3126	depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms.
  3127	
  3128	The next day, 10th of November, the same desertion, the same solitude.
  3129	I did not see one of the ship's crew: Ned and Conseil spent the greater
  3130	part of the day with me.  They were astonished at the puzzling absence
  3131	of the Captain.  Was this singular man ill?--had he altered his
  3132	intentions with regard to us?
  3133	
  3134	After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed perfect liberty, we were
  3135	delicately and abundantly fed.  Our host kept to his terms of the
  3136	treaty.  We could not complain, and, indeed, the singularity of our
  3137	fate reserved such wonderful compensation for us that we had no right
  3138	to accuse it as yet.
  3139	
  3140	That day I commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled
  3141	me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail.
  3142	
  3143	11th November, early in the morning.  The fresh air spreading over the
  3144	interior of the Nautilus told me that we had come to the surface of the
  3145	ocean to renew our supply of oxygen.  I directed my steps to the
  3146	central staircase, and mounted the platform.
  3147	
  3148	It was six o'clock, the weather was cloudy, the sea grey, but calm.
  3149	Scarcely a billow.  Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet, would he be
  3150	there?  I saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage.
  3151	Seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace, I inhaled
  3152	the salt breeze with delight.
  3153	
  3154	By degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the sun's rays, the
  3155	radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon.  The sea flamed under
  3156	its glance like a train of gunpowder.  The clouds scattered in the
  3157	heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades, and
  3158	numerous "mare's tails," which betokened wind for that day.  But what
  3159	was wind to this Nautilus, which tempests could not frighten!
  3160	
  3161	I was admiring this joyous rising of the sun, so gay, and so
  3162	life-giving, when I heard steps approaching the platform.  I was
  3163	prepared to salute Captain Nemo, but it was his second (whom I had
  3164	already seen on the Captain's first visit) who appeared.  He advanced
  3165	on the platform, not seeming to see me.  With his powerful glass to his
  3166	eye, he scanned every point of the horizon with great attention.  This
  3167	examination over, he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in
  3168	exactly these terms.  I have remembered it, for every morning it was
  3169	repeated under exactly the same conditions.  It was thus worded:
  3170	
  3171	"Nautron respoc lorni virch."
  3172	
  3173	What it meant I could not say.
  3174	
  3175	These words pronounced, the second descended.  I thought that the
  3176	Nautilus was about to return to its submarine navigation.  I regained
  3177	the panel and returned to my chamber.
  3178	
  3179	Five days sped thus, without any change in our situation.  Every
  3180	morning I mounted the platform.  The same phrase was pronounced by the
  3181	same individual.  But Captain Nemo did not appear.
  3182	
  3183	I had made up my mind that I should never see him again, when, on the
  3184	16th November, on returning to my room with Ned and Conseil, I found
  3185	upon my table a note addressed to me.  I opened it impatiently.  It was
  3186	written in a bold, clear hand, the characters rather pointed, recalling
  3187	the German type.  The note was worded as follows:
  3188	
  3189	
  3190	TO PROFESSOR ARONNAX, On board the Nautilus.  16th of November, 1867.
  3191	
  3192	Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax to a hunting-party, which will
  3193	take place to-morrow morning in the forests of the Island of Crespo.
  3194	He hopes that nothing will prevent the Professor from being present,
  3195	and he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions.
  3196	
  3197	CAPTAIN NEMO, Commander of the Nautilus.
  3198	
  3199	
  3200	"A hunt!" exclaimed Ned.
  3201	
  3202	"And in the forests of the Island of Crespo!" added Conseil.
  3203	
  3204	"Oh! then the gentleman is going on terra firma?" replied Ned Land.
  3205	
  3206	"That seems to me to be clearly indicated," said I, reading the letter
  3207	once more.
  3208	
  3209	"Well, we must accept," said the Canadian.  "But once more on dry
  3210	ground, we shall know what to do.  Indeed, I shall not be sorry to eat
  3211	a piece of fresh venison."
  3212	
  3213	Without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between Captain
  3214	Nemo's manifest aversion to islands and continents, and his invitation
  3215	to hunt in a forest, I contented myself with replying:
  3216	
  3217	"Let us first see where the Island of Crespo is."
  3218	
  3219	I consulted the planisphere, and in 32° 40' N. lat. and 157°
  3220	50' W. long., I found a small island, recognised in 1801 by Captain
  3221	Crespo, and marked in the ancient Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata,
  3222	the meaning of which is The Silver Rock.  We were then about eighteen
  3223	hundred miles from our starting-point, and the course of the Nautilus,
  3224	a little changed, was bringing it back towards the southeast.
  3225	
  3226	I showed this little rock, lost in the midst of the North Pacific, to
  3227	my companions.
  3228	
  3229	"If Captain Nemo does sometimes go on dry ground," said I, "he at least
  3230	chooses desert islands."
  3231	
  3232	Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and Conseil and he
  3233	left me.
  3234	
  3235	After supper, which was served by the steward, mute and impassive, I
  3236	went to bed, not without some anxiety.
  3237	
  3238	The next morning, the 17th of November, on awakening, I felt that the
  3239	Nautilus was perfectly still.  I dressed quickly and entered the saloon.
  3240	
  3241	Captain Nemo was there, waiting for me.  He rose, bowed, and asked me
  3242	if it was convenient for me to accompany him.  As he made no allusion
  3243	to his absence during the last eight days, I did not mention it, and
  3244	simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him.
  3245	
  3246	We entered the dining-room, where breakfast was served.
  3247	
  3248	"M. Aronnax," said the Captain, "pray, share my breakfast without
  3249	ceremony; we will chat as we eat.  For, though I promised you a walk in
  3250	the forest, I did not undertake to find hotels there.  So breakfast as
  3251	a man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late."
  3252	
  3253	I did honour to the repast.  It was composed of several kinds of fish,
  3254	and slices of sea-cucumber, and different sorts of seaweed.  Our drink
  3255	consisted of pure water, to which the Captain added some drops of a
  3256	fermented liquor, extracted by the Kamschatcha method from a seaweed
  3257	known under the name of Rhodomenia palmata.  Captain Nemo ate at first
  3258	without saying a word.  Then he began:
  3259	
  3260	"Sir, when I proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of Crespo,
  3261	you evidently thought me mad.  Sir, you should never judge lightly of
  3262	any man."
  3263	
  3264	"But Captain, believe me----"
  3265	
  3266	"Be kind enough to listen, and you will then see whether you have any
  3267	cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction."
  3268	
  3269	"I listen."
  3270	
  3271	"You know as well as I do, Professor, that man can live under water,
  3272	providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air.
  3273	In submarine works, the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his
  3274	head in a metal helmet, receives air from above by means of forcing
  3275	pumps and regulators."
  3276	
  3277	"That is a diving apparatus," said I.
  3278	
  3279	"Just so, but under these conditions the man is not at liberty; he is
  3280	attached to the pump which sends him air through an india-rubber tube,
  3281	and if we were obliged to be thus held to the Nautilus, we could not go
  3282	far."
  3283	
  3284	"And the means of getting free?"  I asked.
  3285	
  3286	"It is to use the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own
  3287	countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use, and
  3288	which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological
  3289	conditions without any organ whatever suffering.  It consists of a
  3290	reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a
  3291	pressure of fifty atmospheres.  This reservoir is fixed on the back by
  3292	means of braces, like a soldier's knapsack.  Its upper part forms a box
  3293	in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot
  3294	escape unless at its normal tension.  In the Rouquayrol apparatus such
  3295	as we use, two india rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of
  3296	tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the
  3297	other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other
  3298	according to the wants of the respirator.  But I, in encountering great
  3299	pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut my head, like
  3300	that of a diver in a ball of copper; and it is to this ball of copper
  3301	that the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator, open."
  3302	
  3303	"Perfectly, Captain Nemo; but the air that you carry with you must soon
  3304	be used; when it only contains fifteen per cent.  of oxygen it is no
  3305	longer fit to breathe."
  3306	
  3307	"Right!  But I told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps of the Nautilus
  3308	allow me to store the air under considerable pressure, and on those
  3309	conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air
  3310	for nine or ten hours."
  3311	
  3312	"I have no further objections to make," I answered.  "I will only ask
  3313	you one thing, Captain--how can you light your road at the bottom of
  3314	the sea?"
  3315	
  3316	"With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back,
  3317	the other is fastened to the waist.  It is composed of a Bunsen pile,
  3318	which I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium.  A wire
  3319	is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs it
  3320	towards a particularly made lantern.  In this lantern is a spiral glass
  3321	which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas.  When the apparatus is
  3322	at work this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous
  3323	light.  Thus provided, I can breathe and I can see."
  3324	
  3325	"Captain Nemo, to all my objections you make such crushing answers that
  3326	I dare no longer doubt.  But, if I am forced to admit the Rouquayrol
  3327	and Ruhmkorff apparatus, I must be allowed some reservations with
  3328	regard to the gun I am to carry."
  3329	
  3330	"But it is not a gun for powder," answered the Captain.
  3331	
  3332	"Then it is an air-gun."
  3333	
  3334	"Doubtless!  How would you have me manufacture gun powder on board,
  3335	without either saltpetre, sulphur, or charcoal?"
  3336	
  3337	"Besides," I added, "to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and
  3338	fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable
  3339	resistance."
  3340	
  3341	"That would be no difficulty.  There exist guns, according to Fulton,
  3342	perfected in England by Philip Coles and Burley, in France by Furcy,
  3343	and in Italy by Landi, which are furnished with a peculiar system of
  3344	closing, which can fire under these conditions.  But I repeat, having
  3345	no powder, I use air under great pressure, which the pumps of the
  3346	Nautilus furnish abundantly."
  3347	
  3348	"But this air must be rapidly used?"
  3349	
  3350	"Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at
  3351	need?  A tap is all that is required.  Besides M. Aronnax, you must see
  3352	yourself that, during our submarine hunt, we can spend but little air
  3353	and but few balls."
  3354	
  3355	"But it seems to me that in this twilight, and in the midst of this
  3356	fluid, which is very dense compared with the atmosphere, shots could
  3357	not go far, nor easily prove mortal."
  3358	
  3359	"Sir, on the contrary, with this gun every blow is mortal; and, however
  3360	lightly the animal is touched, it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt."
  3361	
  3362	"Why?"
  3363	
  3364	"Because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but little
  3365	cases of glass.  These glass cases are covered with a case of steel,
  3366	and weighted with a pellet of lead; they are real Leyden bottles, into
  3367	which the electricity is forced to a very high tension.  With the
  3368	slightest shock they are discharged, and the animal, however strong it
  3369	may be, falls dead.  I must tell you that these cases are size number
  3370	four, and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten."
  3371	
  3372	"I will argue no longer," I replied, rising from the table.  "I have
  3373	nothing left me but to take my gun.  At all events, I will go where you
  3374	go."
  3375	
  3376	Captain Nemo then led me aft; and in passing before Ned's and Conseil's
  3377	cabin, I called my two companions, who followed promptly.  We then came
  3378	to a cell near the machinery-room, in which we put on our walking-dress.
  3379	
  3380	
  3381	
  3382	CHAPTER XV
  3383	
  3384	A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
  3385	
  3386	This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the
  3387	Nautilus.  A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting
  3388	our use.
  3389	
  3390	Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in
  3391	one.
  3392	
  3393	"But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing
  3394	but submarine forests."
  3395	
  3396	"Good!" said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh
  3397	meat fade away.  "And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself
  3398	in those clothes?"
  3399	
  3400	"There is no alternative, Master Ned."
  3401	
  3402	"As you please, sir," replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;
  3403	"but, as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one."
  3404	
  3405	"No one will force you, Master Ned," said Captain Nemo.
  3406	
  3407	"Is Conseil going to risk it?" asked Ned.
  3408	
  3409	"I follow my master wherever he goes," replied Conseil.
  3410	
  3411	At the Captain's call two of the ship's crew came to help us dress in
  3412	these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without seam,
  3413	and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure.  One would
  3414	have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting.  This suit
  3415	formed trousers and waistcoat.  The trousers were finished off with
  3416	thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles.  The texture of the
  3417	waistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the
  3418	chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving
  3419	the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way
  3420	restrained the movement of the hands.  There was a vast difference
  3421	noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork
  3422	breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the
  3423	eighteenth century.
  3424	
  3425	Captain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must
  3426	have possessed great strength), Conseil and myself were soon enveloped
  3427	in the dresses.  There remained nothing more to be done but to enclose
  3428	our heads in the metal box.  But, before proceeding to this operation,
  3429	I asked the Captain's permission to examine the guns.
  3430	
  3431	One of the Nautilus men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,
  3432	made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large.  It served as a
  3433	reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,
  3434	allowed to escape into a metal tube.  A box of projectiles in a groove
  3435	in the thickness of the butt end contained about twenty of these
  3436	electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the
  3437	barrel of the gun.  As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.
  3438	
  3439	"Captain Nemo," said I, "this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I
  3440	only ask to be allowed to try it.  But how shall we gain the bottom of
  3441	the sea?"
  3442	
  3443	"At this moment, Professor, the Nautilus is stranded in five fathoms,
  3444	and we have nothing to do but to start."
  3445	
  3446	"But how shall we get off?"
  3447	
  3448	"You shall see."
  3449	
  3450	Captain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the
  3451	same, not without hearing an ironical "Good sport!" from the Canadian.
  3452	The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which
  3453	was screwed the metal helmet.  Three holes, protected by thick glass,
  3454	allowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the
  3455	interior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the
  3456	Rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I
  3457	could breathe with ease.
  3458	
  3459	With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I
  3460	was ready to set out.  But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these
  3461	heavy garments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was
  3462	impossible for me to take a step.
  3463	
  3464	But this state of things was provided for.  I felt myself being pushed
  3465	into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe room.  My companions
  3466	followed, towed along in the same way.  I heard a water-tight door,
  3467	furnished with stopper plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in
  3468	profound darkness.
  3469	
  3470	After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard.  I felt the cold mount
  3471	from my feet to my chest.  Evidently from some part of the vessel they
  3472	had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading
  3473	us, and with which the room was soon filled.  A second door cut in the
  3474	side of the Nautilus then opened.  We saw a faint light.  In another
  3475	instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.
  3476	
  3477	And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk
  3478	under the waters?  Words are impotent to relate such wonders!  Captain
  3479	Nemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind.
  3480	Conseil and I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had
  3481	been possible through our metallic cases.  I no longer felt the weight
  3482	of my clothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick
  3483	helmet, in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its
  3484	shell.
  3485	
  3486	The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the
  3487	ocean, astonished me by its power.  The solar rays shone through the
  3488	watery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly
  3489	distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.
  3490	Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and
  3491	faded into vague obscurity.  Truly this water which surrounded me was
  3492	but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as
  3493	transparent.  Above me was the calm surface of the sea.  We were
  3494	walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore, which
  3495	retains the impression of the billows.  This dazzling carpet, really a
  3496	reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful intensity, which
  3497	accounted for the vibration which penetrated every atom of liquid.
  3498	Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of thirty feet, I
  3499	could see as if I was in broad daylight?
  3500	
  3501	For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable
  3502	dust of shells.  The hull of the Nautilus, resembling a long shoal,
  3503	disappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake
  3504	us in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.
  3505	
  3506	Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible.  I
  3507	recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the
  3508	most beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect
  3509	of this medium.
  3510	
  3511	It was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface
  3512	of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their
  3513	light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,
  3514	plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar
  3515	colours.  It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of
  3516	coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,
  3517	violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an
  3518	enthusiastic colourist!  Why could I not communicate to Conseil the
  3519	lively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in
  3520	expressions of admiration?  For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his
  3521	companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs
  3522	previously agreed upon.  So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I
  3523	declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending
  3524	more air in vain words than was perhaps wise.
  3525	
  3526	Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and
  3527	anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, decked with their
  3528	collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the sandy bottom.  It
  3529	was a real grief to me to crush under my feet the brilliant specimens
  3530	of molluscs which strewed the ground by thousands, of hammerheads,
  3531	donaciae (veritable bounding shells), of staircases, and red
  3532	helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many others produced by this
  3533	inexhaustible ocean.  But we were bound to walk, so we went on, whilst
  3534	above our heads waved medusae whose umbrellas of opal or rose-pink,
  3535	escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from the rays of the sun
  3536	and fiery pelagiae, which, in the darkness, would have strewn our path
  3537	with phosphorescent light.
  3538	
  3539	All these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely
  3540	stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs.
  3541	Soon the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an
  3542	extent of slimy mud which the Americans call "ooze," composed of equal
  3543	parts of silicious and calcareous shells.  We then travelled over a
  3544	plain of seaweed of wild and luxuriant vegetation.  This sward was of
  3545	close texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet
  3546	woven by the hand of man.  But whilst verdure was spread at our feet,
  3547	it did not abandon our heads.  A light network of marine plants, of
  3548	that inexhaustible family of seaweeds of which more than two thousand
  3549	kinds are known, grew on the surface of the water.
  3550	
  3551	I noticed that the green plants kept nearer the top of the sea, whilst
  3552	the red were at a greater depth, leaving to the black or brown the care
  3553	of forming gardens and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.
  3554	
  3555	We had quitted the Nautilus about an hour and a half.  It was near
  3556	noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun's rays, which were no
  3557	longer refracted.  The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the
  3558	shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced.  We walked with a regular
  3559	step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the
  3560	slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is
  3561	unaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound
  3562	than air, in the ratio of four to one.  At this period the earth sloped
  3563	downwards; the light took a uniform tint.  We were at a depth of a
  3564	hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six
  3565	atmospheres.
  3566	
  3567	At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to
  3568	their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest
  3569	state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was
  3570	not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet.  At this
  3571	moment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then
  3572	pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.
  3573	
  3574	"It is the forest of the Island of Crespo," thought I; and I was not
  3575	mistaken.
  3576	
  3577	
  3578	
  3579	CHAPTER XVI
  3580	
  3581	A SUBMARINE FOREST
  3582	
  3583	We had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubtless one of
  3584	the finest of Captain Nemo's immense domains.  He looked upon it as his
  3585	own, and considered he had the same right over it that the first men
  3586	had in the first days of the world.  And, indeed, who would have
  3587	disputed with him the possession of this submarine property?  What
  3588	other hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark
  3589	copses?
  3590	
  3591	This forest was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we
  3592	penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singular
  3593	position of their branches--a position I had not yet observed.
  3594	
  3595	Not an herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed the
  3596	trees, was either broken or bent, nor did they extend horizontally; all
  3597	stretched up to the surface of the ocean.  Not a filament, not a
  3598	ribbon, however thin they might be, but kept as straight as a rod of
  3599	iron.  The fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to
  3600	the density of the element which had produced them.  Motionless yet,
  3601	when bent to one side by the hand, they directly resumed their former
  3602	position.  Truly it was the region of perpendicularity!
  3603	
  3604	I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to the
  3605	comparative darkness which surrounded us.  The soil of the forest
  3606	seemed covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid.  The submarine
  3607	flora struck me as being very perfect, and richer even than it would
  3608	have been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are
  3609	not so plentiful.  But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the
  3610	genera, taking animals for plants; and who would not have been
  3611	mistaken?  The fauna and the flora are too closely allied in this
  3612	submarine world.
  3613	
  3614	These plants are self-propagated, and the principle of their existence
  3615	is in the water, which upholds and nourishes them.  The greater number,
  3616	instead of leaves, shoot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised
  3617	within a scale of colours pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.
  3618	
  3619	"Curious anomaly, fantastic element!" said an ingenious naturalist, "in
  3620	which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!"
  3621	
  3622	In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt; I, for my part,
  3623	was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariae,
  3624	the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows.
  3625	
  3626	This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting but
  3627	the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to
  3628	answer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil's.  I saw the worthy
  3629	fellow's eyes glistening with delight, and, to show his satisfaction,
  3630	he shook himself in his breastplate of air, in the most comical way in
  3631	the world.
  3632	
  3633	After four hours of this walking, I was surprised not to find myself
  3634	dreadfully hungry.  How to account for this state of the stomach I
  3635	could not tell.  But instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep,
  3636	which happens to all divers.  And my eyes soon closed behind the thick
  3637	glasses, and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had
  3638	prevented before.  Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched in
  3639	the clear crystal, set us the example.
  3640	
  3641	How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge, but, when
  3642	I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon.  Captain Nemo had
  3643	already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an
  3644	unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.
  3645	
  3646	A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches
  3647	high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.
  3648	Though my diver's dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of
  3649	this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror.  Conseil and the
  3650	sailor of the Nautilus awoke at this moment.  Captain Nemo pointed out
  3651	the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun
  3652	knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in
  3653	terrible convulsions.  This incident reminded me that other animals
  3654	more to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose
  3655	attacks my diving-dress would not protect me.  I had never thought of
  3656	it before, but I now resolved to be upon my guard.  Indeed, I thought
  3657	that this halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was
  3658	mistaken, for, instead of returning to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo
  3659	continued his bold excursion.  The ground was still on the incline, its
  3660	declivity seemed to be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater
  3661	depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a narrow
  3662	valley, between high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five
  3663	fathoms deep.  Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were
  3664	forty-five fathoms below the limit which nature seems to have imposed
  3665	on man as to his submarine excursions.
  3666	
  3667	I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to
  3668	judge the distance.  But I knew that even in the clearest waters the
  3669	solar rays could not penetrate further.  And accordingly the darkness
  3670	deepened.  At ten paces not an object was visible.  I was groping my
  3671	way, when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light.  Captain Nemo had
  3672	just put his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same,
  3673	and Conseil and I followed their example.  By turning a screw I
  3674	established a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and
  3675	the sea, lit by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of
  3676	thirty-six yards.
  3677	
  3678	As we walked I thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not
  3679	fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch.  But if they did
  3680	approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the
  3681	hunters.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his
  3682	shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on.  At last, after
  3683	about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end.  A wall of
  3684	superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic
  3685	blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but
  3686	which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of
  3687	Crespo.  It was the earth!  Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  A gesture
  3688	of his brought us all to a halt; and, however desirous I might be to
  3689	scale the wall, I was obliged to stop.  Here ended Captain Nemo's
  3690	domains.  And he would not go beyond them.  Further on was a portion of
  3691	the globe he might not trample upon.
  3692	
  3693	The return began.  Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little
  3694	band, directing their course without hesitation.  I thought we were not
  3695	following the same road to return to the Nautilus.  The new road was
  3696	very steep, and consequently very painful.  We approached the surface
  3697	of the sea rapidly.  But this return to the upper strata was not so
  3698	sudden as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might
  3699	have produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on
  3700	internal lesions, so fatal to divers.  Very soon light reappeared and
  3701	grew, and, the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the
  3702	different objects with a spectral ring.  At ten yards and a half deep,
  3703	we walked amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous
  3704	than the birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game
  3705	worthy of a shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the
  3706	Captain shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the
  3707	shrubs.  He fired; I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell
  3708	stunned at some distance from us.  It was a magnificent sea-otter, an
  3709	enhydrus, the only exclusively marine quadruped.  This otter was five
  3710	feet long, and must have been very valuable.  Its skin, chestnut-brown
  3711	above and silvery underneath, would have made one of those beautiful
  3712	furs so sought after in the Russian and Chinese markets: the fineness
  3713	and the lustre of its coat would certainly fetch L80.  I admired this
  3714	curious mammal, with its rounded head ornamented with short ears, its
  3715	round eyes, and white whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet
  3716	and nails, and tufted tail.  This precious animal, hunted and tracked
  3717	by fishermen, has now become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the
  3718	northern parts of the Pacific, or probably its race would soon become
  3719	extinct.
  3720	
  3721	Captain Nemo's companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,
  3722	and we continued our journey.  For one hour a plain of sand lay
  3723	stretched before us.  Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some
  3724	inches of the surface of the water.  I then saw our image clearly
  3725	reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group
  3726	reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every
  3727	point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet
  3728	in the air.
  3729	
  3730	Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which
  3731	formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these
  3732	seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the
  3733	bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops
  3734	multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above
  3735	our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the sea.
  3736	
  3737	On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun shots which
  3738	ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill.  A large bird of great breadth
  3739	of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us.  Captain Nemo's
  3740	companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards
  3741	above the waves.  The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall
  3742	brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter's grasp.  It was an
  3743	albatross of the finest kind.
  3744	
  3745	Our march had not been interrupted by this incident.  For two hours we
  3746	followed these sandy plains, then fields of algae very disagreeable to
  3747	cross.  Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,
  3748	which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters.  It was the
  3749	lantern of the Nautilus.  Before twenty minutes were over we should be
  3750	on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that
  3751	my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen.  But I did not
  3752	reckon on an accidental meeting which delayed our arrival for some time.
  3753	
  3754	I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo
  3755	coming hurriedly towards me.  With his strong hand he bent me to the
  3756	ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil.  At first I knew not
  3757	what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing
  3758	the Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.
  3759	
  3760	I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of
  3761	algae, when, raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, casting
  3762	phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.
  3763	
  3764	My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which
  3765	threatened us.  It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with
  3766	enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter
  3767	ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle.  Monstrous brutes! which
  3768	would crush a whole man in their iron jaws.  I did not know whether
  3769	Conseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silver
  3770	bellies, and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very
  3771	unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a
  3772	naturalist.
  3773	
  3774	Happily the voracious creatures do not see well.  They passed without
  3775	seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a
  3776	miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face
  3777	in the forest.  Half an hour after, guided by the electric light we
  3778	reached the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain
  3779	Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell.  He then
  3780	pressed a knob.  I heard the pumps working in the midst of the vessel,
  3781	I felt the water sinking from around me, and in a few moments the cell
  3782	was entirely empty.  The inside door then opened, and we entered the
  3783	vestry.
  3784	
  3785	There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble, and,
  3786	fairly worn out from want of food and sleep, I returned to my room, in
  3787	great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.
  3788	
  3789	
  3790	
  3791	CHAPTER XVII
  3792	
  3793	FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC
  3794	
  3795	The next morning, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from my
  3796	fatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just as
  3797	the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.
  3798	
  3799	I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo
  3800	appeared.  He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a
  3801	series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had finished, he
  3802	went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly
  3803	on the ocean.  In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the
  3804	Nautilus, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.
  3805	They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night.  These
  3806	sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type
  3807	was visible in all of them.  I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,
  3808	Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote.  They were civil,
  3809	and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I
  3810	could not guess, neither could I question them.
  3811	
  3812	The nets were hauled in.  They were a large kind of "chaluts," like
  3813	those on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chain
  3814	fixed in the smaller meshes kept open.  These pockets, drawn by iron
  3815	poles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in their
  3816	way.  That day they brought up curious specimens from those productive
  3817	coasts.
  3818	
  3819	I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of
  3820	fish.  It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at.  Indeed, the nets
  3821	are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite
  3822	variety.  We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the
  3823	Nautilus and the attraction of the electric light could always renew
  3824	our supply.  These several productions of the sea were immediately
  3825	lowered through the panel to the steward's room, some to be eaten
  3826	fresh, and others pickled.
  3827	
  3828	The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the
  3829	Nautilus was about to continue its submarine excursion, and was
  3830	preparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, the
  3831	Captain turned to me, saying:
  3832	
  3833	"Professor, is not this ocean gifted with real life?  It has its
  3834	tempers and its gentle moods.  Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it
  3835	has woke after a quiet night.  Look!" he continued, "it wakes under the
  3836	caresses of the sun.  It is going to renew its diurnal existence.  It
  3837	is an interesting study to watch the play of its organisation.  It has
  3838	a pulse, arteries, spasms; and I agree with the learned Maury, who
  3839	discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in
  3840	animals.
  3841	
  3842	"Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator
  3843	has caused things to multiply in it--caloric, salt, and animalculae."
  3844	
  3845	When Captain Nemo spoke thus, he seemed altogether changed, and aroused
  3846	an extraordinary emotion in me.
  3847	
  3848	"Also," he added, "true existence is there; and I can imagine the
  3849	foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which,
  3850	like the Nautilus, would ascend every morning to breathe at the surface
  3851	of the water, free towns, independent cities.  Yet who knows whether
  3852	some despot----"
  3853	
  3854	Captain Nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture.  Then,
  3855	addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought:
  3856	
  3857	"M. Aronnax," he asked, "do you know the depth of the ocean?"
  3858	
  3859	"I only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us."
  3860	
  3861	"Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?"
  3862	
  3863	"These are some," I replied, "that I remember.  If I am not mistaken, a
  3864	depth of 8,000 yards has been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500
  3865	yards in the Mediterranean.  The most remarkable soundings have been
  3866	made in the South Atlantic, near the thirty-fifth parallel, and they
  3867	gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards.  To sum up all, it
  3868	is reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled, its mean depth
  3869	would be about one and three-quarter leagues."
  3870	
  3871	"Well, Professor," replied the Captain, "we shall show you better than
  3872	that I hope.  As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tell
  3873	you it is only 4,000 yards."
  3874	
  3875	Having said this, Captain Nemo went towards the panel, and disappeared
  3876	down the ladder.  I followed him, and went into the large drawing-room.
  3877	The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty miles
  3878	an hour.
  3879	
  3880	During the days and weeks that passed, Captain Nemo was very sparing of
  3881	his visits.  I seldom saw him.  The lieutenant pricked the ship's
  3882	course regularly on the chart, so I could always tell exactly the route
  3883	of the Nautilus.
  3884	
  3885	Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the drawing-room were
  3886	opened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the
  3887	submarine world.
  3888	
  3889	The general direction of the Nautilus was south-east, and it kept
  3890	between 100 and 150 yards of depth.  One day, however, I do not know
  3891	why, being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes, it touched
  3892	the bed of the sea.  The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25
  3893	(cent.): a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all
  3894	latitudes.
  3895	
  3896	At three o'clock in the morning of the 26th of November the Nautilus
  3897	crossed the tropic of Cancer at 172° long.  On 27th instant it
  3898	sighted the Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779.  We
  3899	had then gone 4,860 leagues from our starting-point. In the morning,
  3900	when I went on the platform, I saw two miles to windward, Hawaii, the
  3901	largest of the seven islands that form the group.  I saw clearly the
  3902	cultivated ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel
  3903	with the side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise
  3904	5,000 yards above the level of the sea.  Besides other things the nets
  3905	brought up, were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are
  3906	peculiar to that part of the ocean.  The direction of the Nautilus was
  3907	still to the south-east. It crossed the equator December 1, in 142°
  3908	long.; and on the 4th of the same month, after crossing rapidly and
  3909	without anything in particular occurring, we sighted the Marquesas
  3910	group.  I saw, three miles off, Martin's peak in Nouka-Hiva, the
  3911	largest of the group that belongs to France.  I only saw the woody
  3912	mountains against the horizon, because Captain Nemo did not wish to
  3913	bring the ship to the wind.  There the nets brought up beautiful
  3914	specimens of fish:  some with azure fins and tails like gold, the flesh
  3915	of which is unrivalled; some nearly destitute of scales, but of
  3916	exquisite flavour; others, with bony jaws, and yellow-tinged gills, as
  3917	good as bonitos; all fish that would be of use to us.  After leaving
  3918	these charming islands protected by the French flag, from the 4th to
  3919	the 11th of December the Nautilus sailed over about 2,000 miles.
  3920	
  3921	During the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in the
  3922	large drawing-room. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous water
  3923	through the half-open panels.  The Nautilus was immovable.  While its
  3924	reservoirs were filled, it kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a region
  3925	rarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen.
  3926	
  3927	I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the
  3928	Stomach, and I was learning some valuable lessons from it, when Conseil
  3929	interrupted me.
  3930	
  3931	"Will master come here a moment?" he said, in a curious voice.
  3932	
  3933	"What is the matter, Conseil?"
  3934	
  3935	"I want master to look."
  3936	
  3937	I rose, went, and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched.
  3938	
  3939	In a full electric light, an enormous black mass, quite immovable, was
  3940	suspended in the midst of the waters.  I watched it attentively,
  3941	seeking to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean.  But a sudden
  3942	thought crossed my mind.  "A vessel!" I said, half aloud.
  3943	
  3944	"Yes," replied the Canadian, "a disabled ship that has sunk
  3945	perpendicularly."
  3946	
  3947	Ned Land was right; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered
  3948	shrouds still hung from their chains.  The keel seemed to be in good
  3949	order, and it had been wrecked at most some few hours.  Three stumps of
  3950	masts, broken off about two feet above the bridge, showed that the
  3951	vessel had had to sacrifice its masts.  But, lying on its side, it had
  3952	filled, and it was heeling over to port.  This skeleton of what it had
  3953	once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves, but
  3954	sadder still was the sight of the bridge, where some corpses, bound
  3955	with ropes, were still lying.  I counted five--four men, one of whom
  3956	was standing at the helm, and a woman standing by the poop, holding an
  3957	infant in her arms.  She was quite young.  I could distinguish her
  3958	features, which the water had not decomposed, by the brilliant light
  3959	from the Nautilus.  In one despairing effort, she had raised her infant
  3960	above her head--poor little thing!--whose arms encircled its mother's
  3961	neck.  The attitude of the four sailors was frightful, distorted as
  3962	they were by their convulsive movements, whilst making a last effort to
  3963	free themselves from the cords that bound them to the vessel.  The
  3964	steersman alone, calm, with a grave, clear face, his grey hair glued to
  3965	his forehead, and his hand clutching the wheel of the helm, seemed even
  3966	then to be guiding the three broken masts through the depths of the
  3967	ocean.
  3968	
  3969	What a scene!  We were dumb; our hearts beat fast before this
  3970	shipwreck, taken as it were from life and photographed in its last
  3971	moments.  And I saw already, coming towards it with hungry eyes,
  3972	enormous sharks, attracted by the human flesh.
  3973	
  3974	However, the Nautilus, turning, went round the submerged vessel, and in
  3975	one instant I read on the stern--"The Florida, Sunderland."

  3979	CHAPTER XVIII
  3980	
  3981	VANIKORO
  3982	
  3983	This terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime
  3984	catastrophes that the Nautilus was destined to meet with in its route.
  3985	As long as it went through more frequented waters, we often saw the
  3986	hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, and
  3987	deeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, and a thousand other
  3988	iron materials eaten up by rust.  However, on the 11th of December we
  3989	sighted the Pomotou Islands, the old "dangerous group" of Bougainville,
  3990	that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from the
  3991	Island Ducie to that of Lazareff.  This group covers an area of 370
  3992	square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, among
  3993	which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises
  3994	sway.  These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created
  3995	by the daily work of polypi.  Then this new island will be joined later
  3996	on to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch from
  3997	New Zealand and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas.
  3998	
  3999	One day, when I was suggesting this theory to Captain Nemo, he replied
  4000	coldly:
  4001	
  4002	"The earth does not want new continents, but new men."
  4003	
  4004	Chance had conducted the Nautilus towards the Island of
  4005	Clermont-Tonnere, one of the most curious of the group, that was
  4006	discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva. I could study now
  4007	the madreporal system, to which are due the islands in this ocean.
  4008	
  4009	Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals) have a tissue lined
  4010	with a calcareous crust, and the modifications of its structure have
  4011	induced M. Milne Edwards, my worthy master, to class them into five
  4012	sections. The animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by
  4013	millions at the bottom of their cells. Their calcareous deposits become
  4014	rocks, reefs, and large and small islands. Here they form a ring,
  4015	surrounding a little inland lake, that communicates with the sea by
  4016	means of gaps. There they make barriers of reefs like those on the
  4017	coasts of New Caledonia and the various Pomoton islands. In other
  4018	places, like those at Reunion and at Maurice, they raise fringed reefs,
  4019	high, straight walls, near which the depth of the ocean is considerable.
  4020	
  4021	Some cable-lengths off the shores of the Island of Clermont I admired
  4022	the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers. These
  4023	walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas,
  4024	porites, madrepores, and astraeas. These polypi are found particularly
  4025	in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is
  4026	from the upper part that they begin their operations, in which they
  4027	bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that
  4028	support them. Such is, at least, Darwin's theory, who thus explains the
  4029	formation of the _atolls_, a superior theory (to my mind) to that given
  4030	of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or
  4031	volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea.
  4032	
  4033	I could observe closely these curious walls, for perpendicularly they
  4034	were more than 300 yards deep, and our electric sheets lighted up this
  4035	calcareous matter brilliantly. Replying to a question Conseil asked me
  4036	as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised, I astonished
  4037	him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth
  4038	of an inch in a hundred years.
  4039	
  4040	Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the distance, and the
  4041	route of the Nautilus was sensibly changed. After having crossed the
  4042	tropic of Capricorn in 135° longitude, it sailed W.N.W., making
  4043	again for the tropical zone. Although the summer sun was very strong,
  4044	we did not suffer from heat, for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the
  4045	surface, the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees.
  4046	
  4047	On 15th of December, we left to the east the bewitching group of the
  4048	Societies and the graceful Tahiti, queen of the Pacific.  I saw in the
  4049	morning, some miles to the windward, the elevated summits of the
  4050	island.  These waters furnished our table with excellent fish,
  4051	mackerel, bonitos, and some varieties of a sea-serpent.
  4052	
  4053	On the 25th of December the Nautilus sailed into the midst of the New
  4054	Hebrides, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and that Bougainville explored
  4055	in 1768, and to which Cook gave its present name in 1773.  This group
  4056	is composed principally of nine large islands, that form a band of 120
  4057	leagues N.N.S. to S.S.W., between 15° and 2° S. lat., and 164
  4058	deg. and 168° long.  We passed tolerably near to the Island of
  4059	Aurou, that at noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a
  4060	peak of great height.
  4061	
  4062	That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to regret sorely the
  4063	non-celebration of "Christmas," the family fete of which Protestants
  4064	are so fond.  I had not seen Captain Nemo for a week, when, on the
  4065	morning of the 27th, he came into the large drawing-room, always
  4066	seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before.  I was busily
  4067	tracing the route of the Nautilus on the planisphere.  The Captain came
  4068	up to me, put his finger on one spot on the chart, and said this single
  4069	word.
  4070	
  4071	"Vanikoro."
  4072	
  4073	The effect was magical!  It was the name of the islands on which La
  4074	Perouse had been lost!  I rose suddenly.
  4075	
  4076	"The Nautilus has brought us to Vanikoro?"  I asked.
  4077	
  4078	"Yes, Professor," said the Captain.
  4079	
  4080	"And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the
  4081	Astrolabe struck?"
  4082	
  4083	"If you like, Professor."
  4084	
  4085	"When shall we be there?"
  4086	
  4087	"We are there now."
  4088	
  4089	Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily
  4090	scanned the horizon.
  4091	
  4092	To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by
  4093	a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference.  We were close
  4094	to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d'Urville gave the name of
  4095	Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou,
  4096	situated in 16° 4' S. lat., and 164° 32' E. long.  The earth
  4097	seemed covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the
  4098	interior, that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high.  The
  4099	Nautilus, having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait,
  4100	found itself among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty
  4101	fathoms deep.  Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived
  4102	some savages, who appeared greatly surprised at our approach.  In the
  4103	long black body, moving between wind and water, did they not see some
  4104	formidable cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?
  4105	
  4106	Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the wreck of La
  4107	Perouse.
  4108	
  4109	"Only what everyone knows, Captain," I replied.
  4110	
  4111	"And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?" he inquired,
  4112	ironically.
  4113	
  4114	"Easily."
  4115	
  4116	I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d'Urville had made
  4117	known--works from which the following is a brief account.
  4118	
  4119	La Perouse, and his second, Captain de Langle, were sent by Louis XVI,
  4120	in 1785, on a voyage of circumnavigation.  They embarked in the
  4121	corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard
  4122	of.  In 1791, the French Government, justly uneasy as to the fate of
  4123	these two sloops, manned two large merchantmen, the Recherche and the
  4124	Esperance, which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of
  4125	Bruni d'Entrecasteaux.
  4126	
  4127	Two months after, they learned from Bowen, commander of the Albemarle,
  4128	that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of
  4129	New Georgia.  But D'Entrecasteaux, ignoring this communication--rather
  4130	uncertain, besides--directed his course towards the Admiralty Islands,
  4131	mentioned in a report of Captain Hunter's as being the place where La
  4132	Perouse was wrecked.
  4133	
  4134	They sought in vain.  The Esperance and the Recherche passed before
  4135	Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, this voyage was most
  4136	disastrous, as it cost D'Entrecasteaux his life, and those of two of
  4137	his lieutenants, besides several of his crew.
  4138	
  4139	Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor, was the first to find
  4140	unmistakable traces of the wrecks.  On the 15th of May, 1824, his
  4141	vessel, the St. Patrick, passed close to Tikopia, one of the New
  4142	Hebrides.  There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe, sold him the
  4143	handle of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved
  4144	on the hilt.  The Lascar pretended that six years before, during a stay
  4145	at Vanikoro, he had seen two Europeans that belonged to some vessels
  4146	that had run aground on the reefs some years ago.
  4147	
  4148	Dillon guessed that he meant La Perouse, whose disappearance had
  4149	troubled the whole world.  He tried to get on to Vanikoro, where,
  4150	according to the Lascar, he would find numerous debris of the wreck,
  4151	but winds and tides prevented him.
  4152	
  4153	Dillon returned to Calcutta.  There he interested the Asiatic Society
  4154	and the Indian Company in his discovery.  A vessel, to which was given
  4155	the name of the Recherche, was put at his disposal, and he set out,
  4156	23rd January, 1827, accompanied by a French agent.
  4157	
  4158	The Recherche, after touching at several points in the Pacific, cast
  4159	anchor before Vanikoro, 7th July, 1827, in that same harbour of Vanou
  4160	where the Nautilus was at this time.
  4161	
  4162	There it collected numerous relics of the wreck--iron utensils,
  4163	anchors, pulley-strops, swivel-guns, an 18 lb. shot, fragments of
  4164	astronomical instruments, a piece of crown work, and a bronze clock,
  4165	bearing this inscription--"Bazin m'a fait," the mark of the foundry of
  4166	the arsenal at Brest about 1785.  There could be no further doubt.
  4167	
  4168	Dillon, having made all inquiries, stayed in the unlucky place till
  4169	October.  Then he quitted Vanikoro, and directed his course towards New
  4170	Zealand; put into Calcutta, 7th April, 1828, and returned to France,
  4171	where he was warmly welcomed by Charles X.
  4172	
  4173	But at the same time, without knowing Dillon's movements, Dumont
  4174	d'Urville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck.  And they
  4175	had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of St. Louis had
  4176	been found in the hands of some savages of Louisiade and New Caledonia.
  4177	Dumont d'Urville, commander of the Astrolabe, had then sailed, and two
  4178	months after Dillon had left Vanikoro he put into Hobart Town.  There
  4179	he learned the results of Dillon's inquiries, and found that a certain
  4180	James Hobbs, second lieutenant of the Union of Calcutta, after landing
  4181	on an island situated 8° 18' S. lat., and 156° 30' E. long.,
  4182	had seen some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these
  4183	parts.  Dumont d'Urville, much perplexed, and not knowing how to credit
  4184	the reports of low-class journals, decided to follow Dillon's track.
  4185	
  4186	On the 10th of February, 1828, the Astrolabe appeared off Tikopia, and
  4187	took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island; made his
  4188	way to Vanikoro, sighted it on the 12th inst., lay among the reefs
  4189	until the 14th, and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the
  4190	barrier in the harbour of Vanou.
  4191	
  4192	On the 23rd, several officers went round the island and brought back
  4193	some unimportant trifles.  The natives, adopting a system of denials
  4194	and evasions, refused to take them to the unlucky place.  This
  4195	ambiguous conduct led them to believe that the natives had ill-treated
  4196	the castaways, and indeed they seemed to fear that Dumont d'Urville had
  4197	come to avenge La Perouse and his unfortunate crew.
  4198	
  4199	However, on the 26th, appeased by some presents, and understanding that
  4200	they had no reprisals to fear, they led M. Jacquireot to the scene of
  4201	the wreck.
  4202	
  4203	There, in three or four fathoms of water, between the reefs of Pacou
  4204	and Vanou, lay anchors, cannons, pigs of lead and iron, embedded in the
  4205	limy concretions.  The large boat and the whaler belonging to the
  4206	Astrolabe were sent to this place, and, not without some difficulty,
  4207	their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., a brass gun, some
  4208	pigs of iron, and two copper swivel-guns.
  4209	
  4210	Dumont d'Urville, questioning the natives, learned too that La Perouse,
  4211	after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island, had
  4212	constructed a smaller boat, only to be lost a second time.  Where, no
  4213	one knew.
  4214	
  4215	But the French Government, fearing that Dumont d'Urville was not
  4216	acquainted with Dillon's movements, had sent the sloop Bayonnaise,
  4217	commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin, to Vanikoro, which had been
  4218	stationed on the west coast of America.  The Bayonnaise cast her anchor
  4219	before Vanikoro some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but
  4220	found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the
  4221	monument to La Perouse.  That is the substance of what I told Captain
  4222	Nemo.
  4223	
  4224	"So," he said, "no one knows now where the third vessel perished that
  4225	was constructed by the castaways on the island of Vanikoro?"
  4226	
  4227	"No one knows."
  4228	
  4229	Captain Nemo said nothing, but signed to me to follow him into the
  4230	large saloon.  The Nautilus sank several yards below the waves, and the
  4231	panels were opened.
  4232	
  4233	I hastened to the aperture, and under the crustations of coral, covered
  4234	with fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, through myriads of
  4235	charming fish--girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and
  4236	holocentres--I recognised certain debris that the drags had not been
  4237	able to tear up--iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan
  4238	fittings, the stem of a ship, all objects clearly proving the wreck of
  4239	some vessel, and now carpeted with living flowers. While I was looking
  4240	on this desolate scene, Captain Nemo said, in a sad voice:
  4241	
  4242	"Commander La Perouse set out 7th December, 1785, with his vessels La
  4243	Boussole and the Astrolabe.  He first cast anchor at Botany Bay,
  4244	visited the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, then directed his course
  4245	towards Santa Cruz, and put into Namouka, one of the Hapai group.  Then
  4246	his vessels struck on the unknown reefs of Vanikoro.  The Boussole,
  4247	which went first, ran aground on the southerly coast.  The Astrolabe
  4248	went to its help, and ran aground too.  The first vessel was destroyed
  4249	almost immediately.  The second, stranded under the wind, resisted some
  4250	days.  The natives made the castaways welcome.  They installed
  4251	themselves in the island, and constructed a smaller boat with the
  4252	debris of the two large ones.  Some sailors stayed willingly at
  4253	Vanikoro; the others, weak and ill, set out with La Perouse.  They
  4254	directed their course towards the Solomon Islands, and there perished,
  4255	with everything, on the westerly coast of the chief island of the
  4256	group, between Capes Deception and Satisfaction."
  4257	
  4258	"How do you know that?"
  4259	
  4260	"By this, that I found on the spot where was the last wreck."
  4261	
  4262	Captain Nemo showed me a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms,
  4263	and corroded by the salt water.  He opened it, and I saw a bundle of
  4264	papers, yellow but still readable.
  4265	
  4266	They were the instructions of the naval minister to Commander La
  4267	Perouse, annotated in the margin in Louis XVI's handwriting.
  4268	
  4269	"Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!" said Captain Nemo, at last.  "A
  4270	coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will
  4271	find no other."
  4272	
  4273	
  4274	
  4275	CHAPTER XIX
  4276	
  4277	TORRES STRAITS
  4278	
  4279	During the night of the 27th or 28th of December, the Nautilus left the
  4280	shores of Vanikoro with great speed.  Her course was south-westerly,
  4281	and in three days she had gone over the 750 leagues that separated it
  4282	from La Perouse's group and the south-east point of Papua.
  4283	
  4284	Early on the 1st of January, 1863, Conseil joined me on the platform.
  4285	
  4286	"Master, will you permit me to wish you a happy New Year?"
  4287	
  4288	"What!  Conseil; exactly as if I was at Paris in my study at the Jardin
  4289	des Plantes?  Well, I accept your good wishes, and thank you for them.
  4290	Only, I will ask you what you mean by a `Happy New Year' under our
  4291	circumstances?  Do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of
  4292	our imprisonment, or the year that sees us continue this strange
  4293	voyage?"
  4294	
  4295	"Really, I do not know how to answer, master.  We are sure to see
  4296	curious things, and for the last two months we have not had time for
  4297	dullness.  The last marvel is always the most astonishing; and, if we
  4298	continue this progression, I do not know how it will end.  It is my
  4299	opinion that we shall never again see the like.  I think then, with no
  4300	offence to master, that a happy year would be one in which we could see
  4301	everything."
  4302	
  4303	On 2nd January we had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, since
  4304	our starting-point in the Japan Seas.  Before the ship's head stretched
  4305	the dangerous shores of the coral sea, on the north-east coast of
  4306	Australia.  Our boat lay along some miles from the redoubtable bank on
  4307	which Cook's vessel was lost, 10th June, 1770.  The boat in which Cook
  4308	was struck on a rock, and, if it did not sink, it was owing to a piece
  4309	of coral that was broken by the shock, and fixed itself in the broken
  4310	keel.
  4311	
  4312	I had wished to visit the reef, 360 leagues long, against which the
  4313	sea, always rough, broke with great violence, with a noise like
  4314	thunder.  But just then the inclined planes drew the Nautilus down to a
  4315	great depth, and I could see nothing of the high coral walls.  I had to
  4316	content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by the
  4317	nets.  I remarked, among others, some germons, a species of mackerel as
  4318	large as a tunny, with bluish sides, and striped with transverse bands,
  4319	that disappear with the animal's life.
  4320	
  4321	These fish followed us in shoals, and furnished us with very delicate
  4322	food. We took also a large number of gilt-heads, about one and a half
  4323	inches long, tasting like dorys; and flying pyrapeds like submarine
  4324	swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water
  4325	with their phosphorescent light. Among the molluscs and zoophytes, I
  4326	found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians, echini,
  4327	hammers, spurs, dials, cerites, and hyalleae. The flora was represented
  4328	by beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes,
  4329	impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores; and
  4330	among which I gathered an admirable Nemastoma Geliniarois, that was
  4331	classed among the natural curiosities of the museum.
  4332	
  4333	Two days after crossing the coral sea, 4th January, we sighted the
  4334	Papuan coasts.  On this occasion, Captain Nemo informed me that his
  4335	intention was to get into the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Torres.
  4336	His communication ended there.
  4337	
  4338	The Torres Straits are nearly thirty-four leagues wide; but they are
  4339	obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands, islets, breakers, and
  4340	rocks, that make its navigation almost impracticable; so that Captain
  4341	Nemo took all needful precautions to cross them.  The Nautilus,
  4342	floating betwixt wind and water, went at a moderate pace.  Her screw,
  4343	like a cetacean's tail, beat the waves slowly.
  4344	
  4345	Profiting by this, I and my two companions went up on to the deserted
  4346	platform.  Before us was the steersman's cage, and I expected that
  4347	Captain Nemo was there directing the course of the Nautilus.  I had
  4348	before me the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres, and I
  4349	consulted them attentively.  Round the Nautilus the sea dashed
  4350	furiously.  The course of the waves, that went from south-east to
  4351	north-west at the rate of two and a half miles, broke on the coral that
  4352	showed itself here and there.
  4353	
  4354	"This is a bad sea!" remarked Ned Land.
  4355	
  4356	"Detestable indeed, and one that does not suit a boat like the
  4357	Nautilus."
  4358	
  4359	"The Captain must be very sure of his route, for I see there pieces of
  4360	coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly."
  4361	
  4362	Indeed the situation was dangerous, but the Nautilus seemed to slide
  4363	like magic off these rocks.  It did not follow the routes of the
  4364	Astrolabe and the Zelee exactly, for they proved fatal to Dumont
  4365	d'Urville. It bore more northwards, coasted the Islands of Murray, and
  4366	came back to the south-west towards Cumberland Passage.  I thought it
  4367	was going to pass it by, when, going back to north-west, it went
  4368	through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards
  4369	the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais.
  4370	
  4371	I wondered if Captain Nemo, foolishly imprudent, would steer his vessel
  4372	into that pass where Dumont d'Urville's two corvettes touched; when,
  4373	swerving again, and cutting straight through to the west, he steered
  4374	for the Island of Gilboa.
  4375	
  4376	It was then three in the afternoon.  The tide began to recede, being
  4377	quite full.  The Nautilus approached the island, that I still saw, with
  4378	its remarkable border of screw-pines. He stood off it at about two
  4379	miles distant.  Suddenly a shock overthrew me.  The Nautilus just
  4380	touched a rock, and stayed immovable, laying lightly to port side.
  4381	
  4382	When I rose, I perceived Captain Nemo and his lieutenant on the
  4383	platform.  They were examining the situation of the vessel, and
  4384	exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect.
  4385	
  4386	She was situated thus:  Two miles, on the starboard side, appeared
  4387	Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm.  Towards the
  4388	south and east some coral showed itself, left by the ebb.  We had run
  4389	aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling--a sorry
  4390	matter for the floating of the Nautilus.  However, the vessel had not
  4391	suffered, for her keel was solidly joined.  But, if she could neither
  4392	glide off nor move, she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to
  4393	these rocks, and then Captain Nemo's submarine vessel would be done for.
  4394	
  4395	I was reflecting thus, when the Captain, cool and calm, always master
  4396	of himself, approached me.
  4397	
  4398	"An accident?"  I asked.
  4399	
  4400	"No; an incident."
  4401	
  4402	"But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant
  4403	of this land from which you flee?"
  4404	
  4405	Captain Nemo looked at me curiously, and made a negative gesture, as
  4406	much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma
  4407	again.  Then he said:
  4408	
  4409	"Besides, M. Aronnax, the Nautilus is not lost; it will carry you yet
  4410	into the midst of the marvels of the ocean.  Our voyage is only begun,
  4411	and I do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your company."
  4412	
  4413	"However, Captain Nemo," I replied, without noticing the ironical turn
  4414	of his phrase, "the Nautilus ran aground in open sea.  Now the tides
  4415	are not strong in the Pacific; and, if you cannot lighten the Nautilus,
  4416	I do not see how it will be reinflated."
  4417	
  4418	"The tides are not strong in the Pacific:  you are right there,
  4419	Professor; but in Torres Straits one finds still a difference of a yard
  4420	and a half between the level of high and low seas.  To-day is 4th
  4421	January, and in five days the moon will be full.  Now, I shall be very
  4422	much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water
  4423	sufficiently, and render me a service that I should be indebted to her
  4424	for."
  4425	
  4426	Having said this, Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, redescended
  4427	to the interior of the Nautilus.  As to the vessel, it moved not, and
  4428	was immovable, as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with
  4429	their in destructible cement.
  4430	
  4431	"Well, sir?" said Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of
  4432	the Captain.
  4433	
  4434	"Well, friend Ned, we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th
  4435	instant; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it
  4436	off again."
  4437	
  4438	"Really?"
  4439	
  4440	"Really."
  4441	
  4442	"And this Captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide
  4443	will suffice?" said Conseil, simply.
  4444	
  4445	The Canadian looked at Conseil, then shrugged his shoulders.
  4446	
  4447	"Sir, you may believe me when I tell you that this piece of iron will
  4448	navigate neither on nor under the sea again; it is only fit to be sold
  4449	for its weight.  I think, therefore, that the time has come to part
  4450	company with Captain Nemo."
  4451	
  4452	"Friend Ned, I do not despair of this stout Nautilus, as you do; and in
  4453	four days we shall know what to hold to on the Pacific tides.  Besides,
  4454	flight might be possible if we were in sight of the English or
  4455	Provencal coast; but on the Papuan shores, it is another thing; and it
  4456	will be time enough to come to that extremity if the Nautilus does not
  4457	recover itself again, which I look upon as a grave event."
  4458	
  4459	"But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly?  There is an
  4460	island; on that island there are trees; under those trees, terrestrial
  4461	animals, bearers of cutlets and roast beef, to which I would willingly
  4462	give a trial."
  4463	
  4464	"In this, friend Ned is right," said Conseil, "and I agree with him.
  4465	Could not master obtain permission from his friend Captain Nemo to put
  4466	us on land, if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the
  4467	solid parts of our planet?"
  4468	
  4469	"I can ask him, but he will refuse."
  4470	
  4471	"Will master risk it?" asked Conseil, "and we shall know how to rely
  4472	upon the Captain's amiability."
  4473	
  4474	To my great surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,
  4475	and he gave it very agreeably, without even exacting from me a promise
  4476	to return to the vessel; but flight across New Guinea might be very
  4477	perilous, and I should not have counselled Ned Land to attempt it.
  4478	Better to be a prisoner on board the Nautilus than to fall into the
  4479	hands of the natives.
  4480	
  4481	At eight o'clock, armed with guns and hatchets, we got off the
  4482	Nautilus.  The sea was pretty calm; a slight breeze blew on land.
  4483	Conseil and I rowing, we sped along quickly, and Ned steered in the
  4484	straight passage that the breakers left between them.  The boat was
  4485	well handled, and moved rapidly.
  4486	
  4487	Ned Land could not restrain his joy.  He was like a prisoner that had
  4488	escaped from prison, and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it.
  4489	
  4490	"Meat!  We are going to eat some meat; and what meat!" he replied.
  4491	"Real game! no, bread, indeed."
  4492	
  4493	"I do not say that fish is not good; we must not abuse it; but a piece
  4494	of fresh venison, grilled on live coals, will agreeably vary our
  4495	ordinary course."
  4496	
  4497	"Glutton!" said Conseil, "he makes my mouth water."
  4498	
  4499	"It remains to be seen," I said, "if these forests are full of game,
  4500	and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself."
  4501	
  4502	"Well said, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed
  4503	sharpened like the edge of a hatchet; "but I will eat tiger--loin of
  4504	tiger--if there is no other quadruped on this island."
  4505	
  4506	"Friend Ned is uneasy about it," said Conseil.
  4507	
  4508	"Whatever it may be," continued Ned Land, "every animal with four paws
  4509	without feathers, or with two paws without feathers, will be saluted by
  4510	my first shot."
  4511	
  4512	"Very well!  Master Land's imprudences are beginning."
  4513	
  4514	"Never fear, M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian; "I do not want
  4515	twenty-five minutes to offer you a dish, of my sort."
  4516	
  4517	At half-past eight the Nautilus boat ran softly aground on a heavy
  4518	sand, after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the
  4519	Island of Gilboa.
  4520	
  4521	
  4522	
  4523	CHAPTER XX
  4524	
  4525	A FEW DAYS ON LAND
  4526	
  4527	I was much impressed on touching land.  Ned Land tried the soil with
  4528	his feet, as if to take possession of it.  However, it was only two
  4529	months before that we had become, according to Captain Nemo,
  4530	"passengers on board the Nautilus," but, in reality, prisoners of its
  4531	commander.
  4532	
  4533	In a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast.  The whole
  4534	horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests.  Enormous
  4535	trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet, were tied to
  4536	each other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a
  4537	light breeze rocked.  They were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees,
  4538	mingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of their verdant
  4539	vault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.
  4540	
  4541	But, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papuan flora,
  4542	the Canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful.  He discovered a
  4543	coco-tree, beat down some of the fruit, broke them, and we drunk the
  4544	milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the
  4545	ordinary food on the Nautilus.
  4546	
  4547	"Excellent!" said Ned Land.
  4548	
  4549	"Exquisite!" replied Conseil.
  4550	
  4551	"And I do not think," said the Canadian, "that he would object to our
  4552	introducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board."
  4553	
  4554	"I do not think he would, but he would not taste them."
  4555	
  4556	"So much the worse for him," said Conseil.
  4557	
  4558	"And so much the better for us," replied Ned Land.  "There will be more
  4559	for us."
  4560	
  4561	"One word only, Master Land," I said to the harpooner, who was
  4562	beginning to ravage another coco-nut tree.  "Coco-nuts are good things,
  4563	but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre
  4564	and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful.
  4565	Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the Nautilus."
  4566	
  4567	"Master is right," replied Conseil; "and I propose to reserve three
  4568	places in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the
  4569	third for the venison, of which I have not yet seen the smallest
  4570	specimen."
  4571	
  4572	"Conseil, we must not despair," said the Canadian.
  4573	
  4574	"Let us continue," I returned, "and lie in wait.  Although the island
  4575	seems uninhabited, it might still contain some individuals that would
  4576	be less hard than we on the nature of game."
  4577	
  4578	"Ho! ho!" said Ned Land, moving his jaws significantly.
  4579	
  4580	"Well, Ned!" said Conseil.
  4581	
  4582	"My word!" returned the Canadian, "I begin to understand the charms of
  4583	anthropophagy."
  4584	
  4585	"Ned!  Ned! what are you saying?  You, a man-eater? I should not feel
  4586	safe with you, especially as I share your cabin.  I might perhaps wake
  4587	one day to find myself half devoured."
  4588	
  4589	"Friend Conseil, I like you much, but not enough to eat you
  4590	unnecessarily."
  4591	
  4592	"I would not trust you," replied Conseil.  "But enough.  We must
  4593	absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal, or else one
  4594	of these fine mornings, master will find only pieces of his servant to
  4595	serve him."
  4596	
  4597	While we were talking thus, we were penetrating the sombre arches of
  4598	the forest, and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions.
  4599	
  4600	Chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most
  4601	useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food
  4602	that we missed on board.  I would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very
  4603	abundant in the island of Gilboa; and I remarked chiefly the variety
  4604	destitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of "rima."
  4605	
  4606	Ned Land knew these fruits well.  He had already eaten many during his
  4607	numerous voyages, and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance.
  4608	Moreover, the sight of them excited him, and he could contain himself
  4609	no longer.
  4610	
  4611	"Master," he said, "I shall die if I do not taste a little of this
  4612	bread-fruit pie."
  4613	
  4614	"Taste it, friend Ned--taste it as you want.  We are here to make
  4615	experiments--make them."
  4616	
  4617	"It won't take long," said the Canadian.
  4618	
  4619	And, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that
  4620	crackled joyously.  During this time, Conseil and I chose the best
  4621	fruits of the bread-fruit. Some had not then attained a sufficient
  4622	degree of maturity; and their thick skin covered a white but rather
  4623	fibrous pulp.  Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited
  4624	only to be picked.
  4625	
  4626	These fruits enclosed no kernel.  Conseil brought a dozen to Ned Land,
  4627	who placed them on a coal fire, after having cut them in thick slices,
  4628	and while doing this repeating:
  4629	
  4630	"You will see, master, how good this bread is.  More so when one has
  4631	been deprived of it so long.  It is not even bread," added he, "but a
  4632	delicate pastry.  You have eaten none, master?"
  4633	
  4634	"No, Ned."
  4635	
  4636	"Very well, prepare yourself for a juicy thing.  If you do not come for
  4637	more, I am no longer the king of harpooners."
  4638	
  4639	After some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire
  4640	was completely roasted.  The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort
  4641	of soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke.
  4642	
  4643	It must be confessed this bread was excellent, and I ate of it with
  4644	great relish.
  4645	
  4646	"What time is it now?" asked the Canadian.
  4647	
  4648	"Two o'clock at least," replied Conseil.
  4649	
  4650	"How time flies on firm ground!" sighed Ned Land.
  4651	
  4652	"Let us be off," replied Conseil.
  4653	
  4654	We returned through the forest, and completed our collection by a raid
  4655	upon the cabbage-palms, that we gathered from the tops of the trees,
  4656	little beans that I recognised as the "abrou" of the Malays, and yams
  4657	of a superior quality.
  4658	
  4659	We were loaded when we reached the boat.  But Ned Land did not find his
  4660	provisions sufficient.  Fate, however, favoured us.  Just as we were
  4661	pushing off, he perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty
  4662	feet high, a species of palm-tree.
  4663	
  4664	At last, at five o'clock in the evening, loaded with our riches, we
  4665	quitted the shore, and half an hour after we hailed the Nautilus.  No
  4666	one appeared on our arrival.  The enormous iron-plated cylinder seemed
  4667	deserted.  The provisions embarked, I descended to my chamber, and
  4668	after supper slept soundly.
  4669	
  4670	The next day, 6th January, nothing new on board.  Not a sound inside,
  4671	not a sign of life.  The boat rested along the edge, in the same place
  4672	in which we had left it.  We resolved to return to the island.  Ned
  4673	Land hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to
  4674	the hunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest.
  4675	
  4676	At dawn we set off.  The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to
  4677	shore, reached the island in a few minutes.
  4678	
  4679	We landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian,
  4680	we followed Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us.  He
  4681	wound up the coast towards the west:  then, fording some torrents, he
  4682	gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests.  Some
  4683	kingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not
  4684	let themselves be approached.  Their circumspection proved to me that
  4685	these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I
  4686	concluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings
  4687	occasionally frequented it.
  4688	
  4689	After crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a
  4690	little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large
  4691	number of birds.
  4692	
  4693	"There are only birds," said Conseil.
  4694	
  4695	"But they are eatable," replied the harpooner.
  4696	
  4697	"I do not agree with you, friend Ned, for I see only parrots there."
  4698	
  4699	"Friend Conseil," said Ned, gravely, "the parrot is like pheasant to
  4700	those who have nothing else."
  4701	
  4702	"And," I added, "this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and fork."
  4703	
  4704	Indeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, a world of parrots were
  4705	flying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak
  4706	the human language.  For the moment, they were chattering with parrots
  4707	of all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some
  4708	philosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece
  4709	of bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure
  4710	colours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold,
  4711	but few eatable.
  4712	
  4713	However, a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the
  4714	limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands, was wanting in this collection.
  4715	But fortune reserved it for me before long.
  4716	
  4717	After passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain
  4718	obstructed with bushes.  I saw then those magnificent birds, the
  4719	disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the
  4720	wind.  Their undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading
  4721	of their colours, attracted and charmed one's looks.  I had no trouble
  4722	in recognising them.
  4723	
  4724	"Birds of paradise!"  I exclaimed.
  4725	
  4726	The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese,
  4727	have several means that we could not employ for taking them.  Sometimes
  4728	they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise
  4729	prefer to frequent.  Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime
  4730	that paralyses their movements.  They even go so far as to poison the
  4731	fountains that the birds generally drink from.  But we were obliged to
  4732	fire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them
  4733	down; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.
  4734	
  4735	About eleven o'clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that
  4736	form the centre of the island was traversed, and we had killed nothing.
  4737	Hunger drove us on.  The hunters had relied on the products of the
  4738	chase, and they were wrong.  Happily Conseil, to his great surprise,
  4739	made a double shot and secured breakfast.  He brought down a white
  4740	pigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a
  4741	skewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood.  While these
  4742	interesting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the
  4743	bread-tree. Then the wood-pigeons were devoured to the bones, and
  4744	declared excellent.  The nutmeg, with which they are in the habit of
  4745	stuffing their crops, flavours their flesh and renders it delicious
  4746	eating.
  4747	
  4748	"Now, Ned, what do you miss now?"
  4749	
  4750	"Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax.  All these pigeons are only
  4751	side-dishes and trifles; and until I have killed an animal with cutlets
  4752	I shall not be content."
  4753	
  4754	"Nor I, Ned, if I do not catch a bird of paradise."
  4755	
  4756	"Let us continue hunting," replied Conseil.  "Let us go towards the
  4757	sea.  We have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and I
  4758	think we had better regain the region of forests."
  4759	
  4760	That was sensible advice, and was followed out.  After walking for one
  4761	hour we had attained a forest of sago-trees. Some inoffensive serpents
  4762	glided away from us.  The birds of paradise fled at our approach, and
  4763	truly I despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in
  4764	front, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to me
  4765	bringing a magnificent specimen.
  4766	
  4767	"Ah! bravo, Conseil!"
  4768	
  4769	"Master is very good."
  4770	
  4771	"No, my boy; you have made an excellent stroke.  Take one of these
  4772	living birds, and carry it in your hand."
  4773	
  4774	"If master will examine it, he will see that I have not deserved great
  4775	merit."
  4776	
  4777	"Why, Conseil?"
  4778	
  4779	"Because this bird is as drunk as a quail."
  4780	
  4781	"Drunk!"
  4782	
  4783	"Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the
  4784	nutmeg-tree, under which I found it.  See, friend Ned, see the
  4785	monstrous effects of intemperance!"
  4786	
  4787	"By Jove!" exclaimed the Canadian, "because I have drunk gin for two
  4788	months, you must needs reproach me!"
  4789	
  4790	However, I examined the curious bird.  Conseil was right.  The bird,
  4791	drunk with the juice, was quite powerless.  It could not fly; it could
  4792	hardly walk.
  4793	
  4794	This bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are
  4795	found in Papua and in the neighbouring islands.  It was the "large
  4796	emerald bird, the most rare kind." It measured three feet in length.
  4797	Its head was comparatively small, its eyes placed near the opening of
  4798	the beak, and also small.  But the shades of colour were beautiful,
  4799	having a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with
  4800	purple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald
  4801	colour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly.  Two horned,
  4802	downy nets rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light
  4803	feathers of admirable fineness, and they completed the whole of this
  4804	marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the "bird of
  4805	the sun."
  4806	
  4807	But if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of
  4808	paradise, the Canadian's were not yet.  Happily, about two o'clock, Ned
  4809	Land brought down a magnificent hog; from the brood of those the
  4810	natives call "bari-outang." The animal came in time for us to procure
  4811	real quadruped meat, and he was well received.  Ned Land was very proud
  4812	of his shot.  The hog, hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead.  The
  4813	Canadian skinned and cleaned it properly, after having taken half a
  4814	dozen cutlets, destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the
  4815	evening.  Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by Ned
  4816	and Conseil's exploits.
  4817	
  4818	Indeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused a herd of kangaroos
  4819	that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws.  But these animals
  4820	did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could
  4821	stop their course.
  4822	
  4823	"Ah, Professor!" cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights
  4824	of the chase, "what excellent game, and stewed, too!  What a supply for
  4825	the Nautilus!  Two! three! five down!  And to think that we shall eat
  4826	that flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!"
  4827	
  4828	I think that, in the excess of his joy, the Canadian, if he had not
  4829	talked so much, would have killed them all.  But he contented himself
  4830	with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians.  These animals
  4831	were small.  They were a species of those "kangaroo rabbits" that live
  4832	habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but
  4833	they are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food.  We
  4834	were very satisfied with the results of the hunt.  Happy Ned proposed
  4835	to return to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to
  4836	depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds.  But he had reckoned
  4837	without his host.
  4838	
  4839	At six o'clock in the evening we had regained the shore; our boat was
  4840	moored to the usual place.  The Nautilus, like a long rock, emerged
  4841	from the waves two miles from the beach.  Ned Land, without waiting,
  4842	occupied himself about the important dinner business.  He understood
  4843	all about cooking well.  The "bari-outang," grilled on the coals, soon
  4844	scented the air with a delicious odour.
  4845	
  4846	Indeed, the dinner was excellent.  Two wood-pigeons completed this
  4847	extraordinary menu.  The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some
  4848	mangoes, half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some
  4849	coco-nuts, overjoyed us.  I even think that my worthy companions' ideas
  4850	had not all the plainness desirable.
  4851	
  4852	"Suppose we do not return to the Nautilus this evening?" said Conseil.
  4853	
  4854	"Suppose we never return?" added Ned Land.
  4855	
  4856	Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner's
  4857	proposition.
  4858	
  4859	
  4860	
  4861	CHAPTER XXI
  4862	
  4863	CAPTAIN NEMO'S THUNDERBOLT
  4864	
  4865	We looked at the edge of the forest without rising, my hand stopping in
  4866	the action of putting it to my mouth, Ned Land's completing its office.
  4867	
  4868	"Stones do not fall from the sky," remarked Conseil, "or they would
  4869	merit the name aerolites."
  4870	
  4871	A second stone, carefully aimed, that made a savoury pigeon's leg fall
  4872	from Conseil's hand, gave still more weight to his observation.  We all
  4873	three arose, shouldered our guns, and were ready to reply to any attack.
  4874	
  4875	"Are they apes?" cried Ned Land.
  4876	
  4877	"Very nearly--they are savages."
  4878	
  4879	"To the boat!"  I said, hurrying to the sea.
  4880	
  4881	It was indeed necessary to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives
  4882	armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that
  4883	masked the horizon to the right, hardly a hundred steps from us.
  4884	
  4885	Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us.  The savages approached
  4886	us, not running, but making hostile demonstrations.  Stones and arrows
  4887	fell thickly.
  4888	
  4889	Ned Land had not wished to leave his provisions; and, in spite of his
  4890	imminent danger, his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other, he
  4891	went tolerably fast.  In two minutes we were on the shore.  To load the
  4892	boat with provisions and arms, to push it out to sea, and ship the
  4893	oars, was the work of an instant.  We had not gone two cable-lengths,
  4894	when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up
  4895	to their waists.  I watched to see if their apparition would attract
  4896	some men from the Nautilus on to the platform.  But no.  The enormous
  4897	machine, lying off, was absolutely deserted.
  4898	
  4899	Twenty minutes later we were on board.  The panels were open.  After
  4900	making the boat fast, we entered into the interior of the Nautilus.
  4901	
  4902	I descended to the drawing-room, from whence I heard some chords.
  4903	Captain Nemo was there, bending over his organ, and plunged in a
  4904	musical ecstasy.
  4905	
  4906	"Captain!"
  4907	
  4908	He did not hear me.
  4909	
  4910	"Captain!"  I said, touching his hand.
  4911	
  4912	He shuddered, and, turning round, said, "Ah! it is you, Professor?
  4913	Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?"
  4914	
  4915	"Yes Captain; but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds,
  4916	whose vicinity troubles me."
  4917	
  4918	"What bipeds?"
  4919	
  4920	"Savages."
  4921	
  4922	"Savages!" he echoed, ironically.  "So you are astonished, Professor,
  4923	at having set foot on a strange land and finding savages?  Savages!
  4924	where are there not any?  Besides, are they worse than others, these
  4925	whom you call savages?"
  4926	
  4927	"But Captain----"
  4928	
  4929	"How many have you counted?"
  4930	
  4931	"A hundred at least."
  4932	
  4933	"M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, placing his fingers on the organ
  4934	stops, "when all the natives of Papua are assembled on this shore, the
  4935	Nautilus will have nothing to fear from their attacks."
  4936	
  4937	The Captain's fingers were then running over the keys of the
  4938	instrument, and I remarked that he touched only the black keys, which
  4939	gave his melodies an essentially Scotch character.  Soon he had
  4940	forgotten my presence, and had plunged into a reverie that I did not
  4941	disturb.  I went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen;
  4942	for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight.
  4943	I could only see the island indistinctly; but the numerous fires,
  4944	lighted on the beach, showed that the natives did not think of leaving
  4945	it.  I was alone for several hours, sometimes thinking of the
  4946	natives--but without any dread of them, for the imperturbable
  4947	confidence of the Captain was catching--sometimes forgetting them to
  4948	admire the splendours of the night in the tropics.  My remembrances
  4949	went to France in the train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in
  4950	some hours' time.  The moon shone in the midst of the constellations of
  4951	the zenith.
  4952	
  4953	The night slipped away without any mischance, the islanders frightened
  4954	no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay.  The panels were
  4955	open, and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the
  4956	Nautilus.
  4957	
  4958	At six o'clock in the morning of the 8th January I went up on to the
  4959	platform.  The dawn was breaking.  The island soon showed itself
  4960	through the dissipating fogs, first the shore, then the summits.
  4961	
  4962	The natives were there, more numerous than on the day before--five or
  4963	six hundred perhaps--some of them, profiting by the low water, had come
  4964	on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from the Nautilus.  I
  4965	distinguished them easily; they were true Papuans, with athletic
  4966	figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad
  4967	and flat, and white teeth.  Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge,
  4968	showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the Nubians.
  4969	From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of
  4970	bones.  Most of these savages were naked.  Amongst them, I remarked
  4971	some women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of
  4972	herbs, that sustained a vegetable waistband.  Some chiefs had
  4973	ornamented their necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red
  4974	and white; nearly all were armed with bows, arrows, and shields and
  4975	carried on their shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones
  4976	which they cast from their slings with great skill.  One of these
  4977	chiefs, rather near to the Nautilus, examined it attentively.  He was,
  4978	perhaps, a "mado" of high rank, for he was draped in a mat of
  4979	banana-leaves, notched round the edges, and set off with brilliant
  4980	colours.
  4981	
  4982	I could easily have knocked down this native, who was within a short
  4983	length; but I thought that it was better to wait for real hostile
  4984	demonstrations.  Between Europeans and savages, it is proper for the
  4985	Europeans to parry sharply, not to attack.
  4986	
  4987	During low water the natives roamed about near the Nautilus, but were
  4988	not troublesome; I heard them frequently repeat the word "Assai," and
  4989	by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land, an
  4990	invitation that I declined.
  4991	
  4992	So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great
  4993	displeasure of Master Land, who could not complete his provisions.
  4994	
  4995	This adroit Canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat
  4996	that he had brought off the island.  As for the savages, they returned
  4997	to the shore about eleven o'clock in the morning, as soon as the coral
  4998	tops began to disappear under the rising tide; but I saw their numbers
  4999	had increased considerably on the shore.  Probably they came from the
  5000	neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua.  However, I had not
  5001	seen a single native canoe.  Having nothing better to do, I thought of
  5002	dragging these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion
  5003	of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants.  Moreover, it was the last day
  5004	that the Nautilus would pass in these parts, if it float in open sea
  5005	the next day, according to Captain Nemo's promise.
  5006	
  5007	I therefore called Conseil, who brought me a little light drag, very
  5008	like those for the oyster fishery.  Now to work!  For two hours we
  5009	fished unceasingly, but without bringing up any rarities.  The drag was
  5010	filled with midas-ears, harps, melames, and particularly the most
  5011	beautiful hammers I have ever seen.  We also brought up some sea-slugs,
  5012	pearl-oysters, and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the
  5013	pantry on board.
  5014	
  5015	But just when I expected it least, I put my hand on a wonder, I might
  5016	say a natural deformity, very rarely met with.  Conseil was just
  5017	dragging, and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells, when,
  5018	all at once, he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net, to draw out
  5019	a shell, and heard me utter a cry.
  5020	
  5021	"What is the matter, sir?" he asked in surprise.  "Has master been
  5022	bitten?"
  5023	
  5024	"No, my boy; but I would willingly have given a finger for my
  5025	discovery."
  5026	
  5027	"What discovery?"
  5028	
  5029	"This shell," I said, holding up the object of my triumph.
  5030	
  5031	"It is simply an olive porphyry, genus olive, order of the
  5032	pectinibranchidae, class of gasteropods, sub-class mollusca."
  5033	
  5034	"Yes, Conseil; but, instead of being rolled from right to left, this
  5035	olive turns from left to right."
  5036	
  5037	"Is it possible?"
  5038	
  5039	"Yes, my boy; it is a left shell."
  5040	
  5041	Shells are all right-handed, with rare exceptions; and, when by chance
  5042	their spiral is left, amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold.
  5043	
  5044	Conseil and I were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure, and I
  5045	was promising myself to enrich the museum with it, when a stone
  5046	unfortunately thrown by a native struck against, and broke, the
  5047	precious object in Conseil's hand.  I uttered a cry of despair!
  5048	Conseil took up his gun, and aimed at a savage who was poising his
  5049	sling at ten yards from him.  I would have stopped him, but his blow
  5050	took effect and broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm
  5051	of the savage.
  5052	
  5053	"Conseil!" cried I. "Conseil!"
  5054	
  5055	"Well, sir! do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?"
  5056	
  5057	"A shell is not worth the life of a man," said I.
  5058	
  5059	"Ah! the scoundrel!" cried Conseil; "I would rather he had broken my
  5060	shoulder!"
  5061	
  5062	Conseil was in earnest, but I was not of his opinion.  However, the
  5063	situation had changed some minutes before, and we had not perceived.  A
  5064	score of canoes surrounded the Nautilus.  These canoes, scooped out of
  5065	the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed, were
  5066	balanced by means of a long bamboo pole, which floated on the water.
  5067	They were managed by skilful, half-naked paddlers, and I watched their
  5068	advance with some uneasiness.  It was evident that these Papuans had
  5069	already had dealings with the Europeans and knew their ships.  But this
  5070	long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys, what
  5071	could they think of it?  Nothing good, for at first they kept at a
  5072	respectful distance.  However, seeing it motionless, by degrees they
  5073	took courage, and sought to familiarise themselves with it.  Now this
  5074	familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid.  Our arms,
  5075	which were noiseless, could only produce a moderate effect on the
  5076	savages, who have little respect for aught but blustering things.  The
  5077	thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man
  5078	but little, though the danger lies in the lightning, not in the noise.
  5079	
  5080	At this moment the canoes approached the Nautilus, and a shower of
  5081	arrows alighted on her.
  5082	
  5083	I went down to the saloon, but found no one there.  I ventured to knock
  5084	at the door that opened into the Captain's room.  "Come in," was the
  5085	answer.
  5086	
  5087	I entered, and found Captain Nemo deep in algebraical calculations of
  5088	_x_ and other quantities.
  5089	
  5090	"I am disturbing you," said I, for courtesy's sake.
  5091	
  5092	"That is true, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain; "but I think you have
  5093	serious reasons for wishing to see me?"
  5094	
  5095	"Very grave ones; the natives are surrounding us in their canoes, and
  5096	in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of
  5097	savages."
  5098	
  5099	"Ah!" said Captain Nemo quietly, "they are come with their canoes?"
  5100	
  5101	"Yes, sir."
  5102	
  5103	"Well, sir, we must close the hatches."
  5104	
  5105	"Exactly, and I came to say to you----"
  5106	
  5107	"Nothing can be more simple," said Captain Nemo.  And, pressing an
  5108	electric button, he transmitted an order to the ship's crew.
  5109	
  5110	"It is all done, sir," said he, after some moments.  "The pinnace is
  5111	ready, and the hatches are closed.  You do not fear, I imagine, that
  5112	these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate
  5113	have had no effect?"
  5114	
  5115	"No, Captain; but a danger still exists."
  5116	
  5117	"What is that, sir?"
  5118	
  5119	"It is that to-morrow, at about this hour, we must open the hatches to
  5120	renew the air of the Nautilus.  Now, if, at this moment, the Papuans
  5121	should occupy the platform, I do not see how you could prevent them
  5122	from entering."
  5123	
  5124	"Then, sir, you suppose that they will board us?"
  5125	
  5126	"I am certain of it."
  5127	
  5128	"Well, sir, let them come.  I see no reason for hindering them.  After
  5129	all, these Papuans are poor creatures, and I am unwilling that my visit
  5130	to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches."
  5131	
  5132	Upon that I was going away; But Captain Nemo detained me, and asked me
  5133	to sit down by him.  He questioned me with interest about our
  5134	excursions on shore, and our hunting; and seemed not to understand the
  5135	craving for meat that possessed the Canadian.  Then the conversation
  5136	turned on various subjects, and, without being more communicative,
  5137	Captain Nemo showed himself more amiable.
  5138	
  5139	Amongst other things, we happened to speak of the situation of the
  5140	Nautilus, run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where
  5141	Dumont d'Urville was nearly lost.  Apropos of this:
  5142	
  5143	"This D'Urville was one of your great sailors," said the Captain to me,
  5144	"one of your most intelligent navigators.  He is the Captain Cook of
  5145	you Frenchmen.  Unfortunate man of science, after having braved the
  5146	icebergs of the South Pole, the coral reefs of Oceania, the cannibals
  5147	of the Pacific, to perish miserably in a railway train!  If this
  5148	energetic man could have reflected during the last moments of his life,
  5149	what must have been uppermost in his last thoughts, do you suppose?"
  5150	
  5151	So speaking, Captain Nemo seemed moved, and his emotion gave me a
  5152	better opinion of him.  Then, chart in hand, we reviewed the travels of
  5153	the French navigator, his voyages of circumnavigation, his double
  5154	detention at the South Pole, which led to the discovery of Adelaide and
  5155	Louis Philippe, and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal
  5156	islands of Oceania.
  5157	
  5158	"That which your D'Urville has done on the surface of the seas," said
  5159	Captain Nemo, "that have I done under them, and more easily, more
  5160	completely than he.  The Astrolabe and the Zelee, incessantly tossed
  5161	about by the hurricane, could not be worth the Nautilus, quiet
  5162	repository of labour that she is, truly motionless in the midst of the
  5163	waters.
  5164	
  5165	"To-morrow," added the Captain, rising, "to-morrow, at twenty minutes
  5166	to three p.m., the Nautilus shall float, and leave the Strait of Torres
  5167	uninjured."
  5168	
  5169	Having curtly pronounced these words, Captain Nemo bowed slightly.
  5170	This was to dismiss me, and I went back to my room.
  5171	
  5172	There I found Conseil, who wished to know the result of my interview
  5173	with the Captain.
  5174	
  5175	"My boy," said I, "when I feigned to believe that his Nautilus was
  5176	threatened by the natives of Papua, the Captain answered me very
  5177	sarcastically.  I have but one thing to say to you: Have confidence in
  5178	him, and go to sleep in peace."
  5179	
  5180	"Have you no need of my services, sir?"
  5181	
  5182	"No, my friend.  What is Ned Land doing?"
  5183	
  5184	"If you will excuse me, sir," answered Conseil, "friend Ned is busy
  5185	making a kangaroo-pie which will be a marvel."
  5186	
  5187	I remained alone and went to bed, but slept indifferently.  I heard the
  5188	noise of the savages, who stamped on the platform, uttering deafening
  5189	cries.  The night passed thus, without disturbing the ordinary repose
  5190	of the crew.  The presence of these cannibals affected them no more
  5191	than the soldiers of a masked battery care for the ants that crawl over
  5192	its front.
  5193	
  5194	At six in the morning I rose.  The hatches had not been opened.  The
  5195	inner air was not renewed, but the reservoirs, filled ready for any
  5196	emergency, were now resorted to, and discharged several cubic feet of
  5197	oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the Nautilus.
  5198	
  5199	I worked in my room till noon, without having seen Captain Nemo, even
  5200	for an instant.  On board no preparations for departure were visible.
  5201	
  5202	I waited still some time, then went into the large saloon.  The clock
  5203	marked half-past two.  In ten minutes it would be high-tide: and, if
  5204	Captain Nemo had not made a rash promise, the Nautilus would be
  5205	immediately detached.  If not, many months would pass ere she could
  5206	leave her bed of coral.
  5207	
  5208	However, some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel.  I
  5209	heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral
  5210	reef.
  5211	
  5212	At five-and-twenty minutes to three, Captain Nemo appeared in the
  5213	saloon.
  5214	
  5215	"We are going to start," said he.
  5216	
  5217	"Ah!" replied I.
  5218	
  5219	"I have given the order to open the hatches."
  5220	
  5221	"And the Papuans?"
  5222	
  5223	"The Papuans?" answered Captain Nemo, slightly shrugging his shoulders.
  5224	
  5225	"Will they not come inside the Nautilus?"
  5226	
  5227	"How?"
  5228	
  5229	"Only by leaping over the hatches you have opened."
  5230	
  5231	"M. Aronnax," quietly answered Captain Nemo, "they will not enter the
  5232	hatches of the Nautilus in that way, even if they were open."
  5233	
  5234	I looked at the Captain.
  5235	
  5236	"You do not understand?" said he.
  5237	
  5238	"Hardly."
  5239	
  5240	"Well, come and you will see."
  5241	
  5242	I directed my steps towards the central staircase.  There Ned Land and
  5243	Conseil were slyly watching some of the ship's crew, who were opening
  5244	the hatches, while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded
  5245	outside.
  5246	
  5247	The port lids were pulled down outside.  Twenty horrible faces
  5248	appeared.  But the first native who placed his hand on the stair-rail,
  5249	struck from behind by some invisible force, I know not what, fled,
  5250	uttering the most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions.
  5251	
  5252	Ten of his companions followed him.  They met with the same fate.
  5253	
  5254	Conseil was in ecstasy.  Ned Land, carried away by his violent
  5255	instincts, rushed on to the staircase.  But the moment he seized the
  5256	rail with both hands, he, in his turn, was overthrown.
  5257	
  5258	"I am struck by a thunderbolt," cried he, with an oath.
  5259	
  5260	This explained all.  It was no rail; but a metallic cable charged with
  5261	electricity from the deck communicating with the platform.  Whoever
  5262	touched it felt a powerful shock--and this shock would have been mortal
  5263	if Captain Nemo had discharged into the conductor the whole force of
  5264	the current.  It might truly be said that between his assailants and
  5265	himself he had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass
  5266	with impunity.
  5267	
  5268	Meanwhile, the exasperated Papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with
  5269	terror.  As for us, half laughing, we consoled and rubbed the
  5270	unfortunate Ned Land, who swore like one possessed.
  5271	
  5272	But at this moment the Nautilus, raised by the last waves of the tide,
  5273	quitted her coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the
  5274	Captain.  Her screw swept the waters slowly and majestically.  Her
  5275	speed increased gradually, and, sailing on the surface of the ocean,
  5276	she quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the Straits of
  5277	Torres.
  5278	
  5279	
  5280	
  5281	CHAPTER XXII
  5282	
  5283	"AEGRI SOMNIA"
  5284	
  5285	The following day 10th January, the Nautilus continued her course
  5286	between two seas, but with such remarkable speed that I could not
  5287	estimate it at less than thirty-five miles an hour.  The rapidity of
  5288	her screw was such that I could neither follow nor count its
  5289	revolutions.  When I reflected that this marvellous electric agent,
  5290	after having afforded motion, heat, and light to the Nautilus, still
  5291	protected her from outward attack, and transformed her into an ark of
  5292	safety which no profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken,
  5293	my admiration was unbounded, and from the structure it extended to the
  5294	engineer who had called it into existence.
  5295	
  5296	Our course was directed to the west, and on the 11th of January we
  5297	doubled Cape Wessel, situation in 135° long. and 10° S. lat.,
  5298	which forms the east point of the Gulf of Carpentaria.  The reefs were
  5299	still numerous, but more equalised, and marked on the chart with
  5300	extreme precision.  The Nautilus easily avoided the breakers of Money
  5301	to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard, placed at 130° long.
  5302	and on the 10th parallel, which we strictly followed.
  5303	
  5304	On the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and
  5305	recognised the island of that name in 122° long.
  5306	
  5307	From this point the direction of the Nautilus inclined towards the
  5308	south-west. Her head was set for the Indian Ocean.  Where would the
  5309	fancy of Captain Nemo carry us next?  Would he return to the coast of
  5310	Asia or would he approach again the shores of Europe?  Improbable
  5311	conjectures both, to a man who fled from inhabited continents.  Then
  5312	would he descend to the south?  Was he going to double the Cape of Good
  5313	Hope, then Cape Horn, and finally go as far as the Antarctic pole?
  5314	Would he come back at last to the Pacific, where his Nautilus could
  5315	sail free and independently?  Time would show.
  5316	
  5317	After having skirted the sands of Cartier, of Hibernia, Seringapatam,
  5318	and Scott, last efforts of the solid against the liquid element, on the
  5319	14th of January we lost sight of land altogether.  The speed of the
  5320	Nautilus was considerably abated, and with irregular course she
  5321	sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters, sometimes floated on their
  5322	surface.
  5323	
  5324	During this period of the voyage, Captain Nemo made some interesting
  5325	experiments on the varied temperature of the sea, in different beds.
  5326	Under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of
  5327	rather complicated instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, by
  5328	means of thermometrical sounding-leads, the glasses often breaking
  5329	under the pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on the
  5330	variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents.
  5331	Results so obtained could not be correctly calculated.  On the
  5332	contrary, Captain Nemo went himself to test the temperature in the
  5333	depths of the sea, and his thermometer, placed in communication with
  5334	the different sheets of water, gave him the required degree immediately
  5335	and accurately.
  5336	
  5337	It was thus that, either by overloading her reservoirs or by descending
  5338	obliquely by means of her inclined planes, the Nautilus successively
  5339	attained the depth of three, four, five, seven, nine, and ten thousand
  5340	yards, and the definite result of this experience was that the sea
  5341	preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half at a depth
  5342	of five thousand fathoms under all latitudes.
  5343	
  5344	On the 16th of January, the Nautilus seemed becalmed only a few yards
  5345	beneath the surface of the waves.  Her electric apparatus remained
  5346	inactive and her motionless screw left her to drift at the mercy of the
  5347	currents.  I supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs,
  5348	rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of the
  5349	machine.
  5350	
  5351	My companions and I then witnessed a curious spectacle.  The hatches of
  5352	the saloon were open, and, as the beacon light of the Nautilus was not
  5353	in action, a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters.  I
  5354	observed the state of the sea, under these conditions, and the largest
  5355	fish appeared to me no more than scarcely defined shadows, when the
  5356	Nautilus found herself suddenly transported into full light.  I thought
  5357	at first that the beacon had been lighted, and was casting its electric
  5358	radiance into the liquid mass.  I was mistaken, and after a rapid
  5359	survey perceived my error.
  5360	
  5361	The Nautilus floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which, in
  5362	this obscurity, became quite dazzling.  It was produced by myriads of
  5363	luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided
  5364	over the metallic hull of the vessel.  I was surprised by lightning in
  5365	the midst of these luminous sheets, as though they had been rivulets of
  5366	lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white
  5367	heat, so that, by force of contrast, certain portions of light appeared
  5368	to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition, from which all
  5369	shade seemed banished.  No; this was not the calm irradiation of our
  5370	ordinary lightning.  There was unusual life and vigour: this was truly
  5371	living light!
  5372	
  5373	In reality, it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria, of
  5374	veritable globules of jelly, provided with a threadlike tentacle, and
  5375	of which as many as twenty-five thousand have been counted in less than
  5376	two cubic half-inches of water.
  5377	
  5378	During several hours the Nautilus floated in these brilliant waves, and
  5379	our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters disporting
  5380	themselves like salamanders.  I saw there in the midst of this fire
  5381	that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise (the indefatigable clown
  5382	of the ocean), and some swordfish ten feet long, those prophetic
  5383	heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would now and then
  5384	strike the glass of the saloon.  Then appeared the smaller fish, the
  5385	balista, the leaping mackerel, wolf-thorn-tails, and a hundred others
  5386	which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam.  This dazzling
  5387	spectacle was enchanting!  Perhaps some atmospheric condition increased
  5388	the intensity of this phenomenon.  Perhaps some storm agitated the
  5389	surface of the waves.  But at this depth of some yards, the Nautilus
  5390	was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still water.
  5391	
  5392	So we progressed, incessantly charmed by some new marvel.  The days
  5393	passed rapidly away, and I took no account of them.  Ned, according to
  5394	habit, tried to vary the diet on board.  Like snails, we were fixed to
  5395	our shells, and I declare it is easy to lead a snail's life.
  5396	
  5397	Thus this life seemed easy and natural, and we thought no longer of the
  5398	life we led on land; but something happened to recall us to the
  5399	strangeness of our situation.
  5400	
  5401	On the 18th of January, the Nautilus was in 105° long. and 15°
  5402	S. lat.  The weather was threatening, the sea rough and rolling.  There
  5403	was a strong east wind.  The barometer, which had been going down for
  5404	some days, foreboded a coming storm.  I went up on to the platform just
  5405	as the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles,
  5406	and waited, according to habit till the daily phrase was said.  But on
  5407	this day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible.
  5408	Almost directly, I saw Captain Nemo appear with a glass, looking
  5409	towards the horizon.
  5410	
  5411	For some minutes he was immovable, without taking his eye off the point
  5412	of observation.  Then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few words
  5413	with his lieutenant.  The latter seemed to be a victim to some emotion
  5414	that he tried in vain to repress.  Captain Nemo, having more command
  5415	over himself, was cool.  He seemed, too, to be making some objections
  5416	to which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances.  At least I
  5417	concluded so by the difference of their tones and gestures.  For
  5418	myself, I had looked carefully in the direction indicated without
  5419	seeing anything.  The sky and water were lost in the clear line of the
  5420	horizon.
  5421	
  5422	However, Captain Nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other,
  5423	without looking at me, perhaps without seeing me.  His step was firm,
  5424	but less regular than usual.  He stopped sometimes, crossed his arms,
  5425	and observed the sea.  What could he be looking for on that immense
  5426	expanse?
  5427	
  5428	The Nautilus was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast.
  5429	
  5430	The lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon
  5431	steadfastly, going and coming, stamping his foot and showing more
  5432	nervous agitation than his superior officer.  Besides, this mystery
  5433	must necessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from
  5434	Captain Nemo, the engine, increasing its propelling power, made the
  5435	screw turn more rapidly.
  5436	
  5437	Just then the lieutenant drew the Captain's attention again.  The
  5438	latter stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place
  5439	indicated.  He looked long.  I felt very much puzzled, and descended to
  5440	the drawing-room, and took out an excellent telescope that I generally
  5441	used.  Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light that jutted out
  5442	from the front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of
  5443	the sky and sea.
  5444	
  5445	But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly
  5446	snatched out of my hands.
  5447	
  5448	I turned round.  Captain Nemo was before me, but I did not know him.
  5449	His face was transfigured.  His eyes flashed sullenly; his teeth were
  5450	set; his stiff body, clenched fists, and head shrunk between his
  5451	shoulders, betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole
  5452	frame.  He did not move.  My glass, fallen from his hands, had rolled
  5453	at his feet.
  5454	
  5455	Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger?  Did this
  5456	incomprehensible person imagine that I had discovered some forbidden
  5457	secret?  No; I was not the object of this hatred, for he was not
  5458	looking at me; his eye was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point
  5459	of the horizon.  At last Captain Nemo recovered himself.  His agitation
  5460	subsided.  He addressed some words in a foreign language to his
  5461	lieutenant, then turned to me.  "M. Aronnax," he said, in rather an
  5462	imperious tone, "I require you to keep one of the conditions that bind
  5463	you to me."
  5464	
  5465	"What is it, Captain?"
  5466	
  5467	"You must be confined, with your companions, until I think fit to
  5468	release you."
  5469	
  5470	"You are the master," I replied, looking steadily at him.  "But may I
  5471	ask you one question?"
  5472	
  5473	"None, sir."
  5474	
  5475	There was no resisting this imperious command, it would have been
  5476	useless.  I went down to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil,
  5477	and told them the Captain's determination.  You may judge how this
  5478	communication was received by the Canadian.
  5479	
  5480	But there was not time for altercation.  Four of the crew waited at the
  5481	door, and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night
  5482	on board the Nautilus.
  5483	
  5484	Ned Land would have remonstrated, but the door was shut upon him.
  5485	
  5486	"Will master tell me what this means?" asked Conseil.
  5487	
  5488	I told my companions what had passed.  They were as much astonished as
  5489	I, and equally at a loss how to account for it.
  5490	
  5491	Meanwhile, I was absorbed in my own reflections, and could think of
  5492	nothing but the strange fear depicted in the Captain's countenance.  I
  5493	was utterly at a loss to account for it, when my cogitations were
  5494	disturbed by these words from Ned Land:
  5495	
  5496	"Hallo! breakfast is ready."
  5497	
  5498	And indeed the table was laid.  Evidently Captain Nemo had given this
  5499	order at the same time that he had hastened the speed of the Nautilus.
  5500	
  5501	"Will master permit me to make a recommendation?" asked Conseil.
  5502	
  5503	"Yes, my boy."
  5504	
  5505	"Well, it is that master breakfasts.  It is prudent, for we do not know
  5506	what may happen."
  5507	
  5508	"You are right, Conseil."
  5509	
  5510	"Unfortunately," said Ned Land, "they have only given us the ship's
  5511	fare."
  5512	
  5513	"Friend Ned," asked Conseil, "what would you have said if the breakfast
  5514	had been entirely forgotten?"
  5515	
  5516	This argument cut short the harpooner's recriminations.
  5517	
  5518	We sat down to table.  The meal was eaten in silence.
  5519	
  5520	Just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out, and left
  5521	us in total darkness.  Ned Land was soon asleep, and what astonished me
  5522	was that Conseil went off into a heavy slumber.  I was thinking what
  5523	could have caused his irresistible drowsiness, when I felt my brain
  5524	becoming stupefied.  In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, they
  5525	would close.  A painful suspicion seized me.  Evidently soporific
  5526	substances had been mixed with the food we had just taken.
  5527	Imprisonment was not enough to conceal Captain Nemo's projects from us,
  5528	sleep was more necessary.  I then heard the panels shut.  The
  5529	undulations of the sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased.
  5530	Had the Nautilus quitted the surface of the ocean?  Had it gone back to
  5531	the motionless bed of water?  I tried to resist sleep.  It was
  5532	impossible.  My breathing grew weak.  I felt a mortal cold freeze my
  5533	stiffened and half-paralysed limbs.  My eye lids, like leaden caps,
  5534	fell over my eyes.  I could not raise them; a morbid sleep, full of
  5535	hallucinations, bereft me of my being.  Then the visions disappeared,
  5536	and left me in complete insensibility.
  5537	
  5538	
  5539	
  5540	CHAPTER XXIII
  5541	
  5542	THE CORAL KINGDOM
  5543	
  5544	The next day I woke with my head singularly clear.  To my great
  5545	surprise, I was in my own room.  My companions, no doubt, had been
  5546	reinstated in their cabin, without having perceived it any more than I.
  5547	Of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as I was, and
  5548	to penetrate this mystery I only reckoned upon the chances of the
  5549	future.
  5550	
  5551	I then thought of quitting my room.  Was I free again or a prisoner?
  5552	Quite free.  I opened the door, went to the half-deck, went up the
  5553	central stairs.  The panels, shut the evening before, were open.  I
  5554	went on to the platform.
  5555	
  5556	Ned Land and Conseil waited there for me.  I questioned them; they knew
  5557	nothing.  Lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally
  5558	unconscious, they had been astonished at finding themselves in their
  5559	cabin.
  5560	
  5561	As for the Nautilus, it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever.  It
  5562	floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace.  Nothing seemed
  5563	changed on board.
  5564	
  5565	The second lieutenant then came on to the platform, and gave the usual
  5566	order below.
  5567	
  5568	As for Captain Nemo, he did not appear.
  5569	
  5570	Of the people on board, I only saw the impassive steward, who served me
  5571	with his usual dumb regularity.
  5572	
  5573	About two o'clock, I was in the drawing-room, busied in arranging my
  5574	notes, when the Captain opened the door and appeared.  I bowed.  He
  5575	made a slight inclination in return, without speaking.  I resumed my
  5576	work, hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the
  5577	events of the preceding night.  He made none.  I looked at him.  He
  5578	seemed fatigued; his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; his
  5579	face looked very sorrowful.  He walked to and fro, sat down and got up
  5580	again, took a chance book, put it down, consulted his instruments
  5581	without taking his habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy.  At
  5582	last, he came up to me, and said:
  5583	
  5584	"Are you a doctor, M. Aronnax?"
  5585	
  5586	I so little expected such a question that I stared some time at him
  5587	without answering.
  5588	
  5589	"Are you a doctor?" he repeated.  "Several of your colleagues have
  5590	studied medicine."
  5591	
  5592	"Well," said I, "I am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital.  I
  5593	practised several years before entering the museum."
  5594	
  5595	"Very well, sir."
  5596	
  5597	My answer had evidently satisfied the Captain.  But, not knowing what
  5598	he would say next, I waited for other questions, reserving my answers
  5599	according to circumstances.
  5600	
  5601	"M. Aronnax, will you consent to prescribe for one of my men?" he asked.
  5602	
  5603	"Is he ill?"
  5604	
  5605	"Yes."
  5606	
  5607	"I am ready to follow you."
  5608	
  5609	"Come, then."
  5610	
  5611	I own my heart beat, I do not know why.  I saw certain connection
  5612	between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day
  5613	before; and this mystery interested me at least as much as the sick man.
  5614	
  5615	Captain Nemo conducted me to the poop of the Nautilus, and took me into
  5616	a cabin situated near the sailors' quarters.
  5617	
  5618	There, on a bed, lay a man about forty years of age, with a resolute
  5619	expression of countenance, a true type of an Anglo-Saxon.
  5620	
  5621	I leant over him.  He was not only ill, he was wounded.  His head,
  5622	swathed in bandages covered with blood, lay on a pillow.  I undid the
  5623	bandages, and the wounded man looked at me with his large eyes and gave
  5624	no sign of pain as I did it.  It was a horrible wound.  The skull,
  5625	shattered by some deadly weapon, left the brain exposed, which was much
  5626	injured.  Clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass, in
  5627	colour like the dregs of wine.
  5628	
  5629	There was both contusion and suffusion of the brain.  His breathing was
  5630	slow, and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated his face.  I
  5631	felt his pulse.  It was intermittent.  The extremities of the body were
  5632	growing cold already, and I saw death must inevitably ensue.  After
  5633	dressing the unfortunate man's wounds, I readjusted the bandages on his
  5634	head, and turned to Captain Nemo.
  5635	
  5636	"What caused this wound?"  I asked.
  5637	
  5638	"What does it signify?" he replied, evasively.  "A shock has broken one
  5639	of the levers of the engine, which struck myself.  But your opinion as
  5640	to his state?"
  5641	
  5642	I hesitated before giving it.
  5643	
  5644	"You may speak," said the Captain.  "This man does not understand
  5645	French."
  5646	
  5647	I gave a last look at the wounded man.
  5648	
  5649	"He will be dead in two hours."
  5650	
  5651	"Can nothing save him?"
  5652	
  5653	"Nothing."
  5654	
  5655	Captain Nemo's hand contracted, and some tears glistened in his eyes,
  5656	which I thought incapable of shedding any.
  5657	
  5658	For some moments I still watched the dying man, whose life ebbed
  5659	slowly.  His pallor increased under the electric light that was shed
  5660	over his death-bed. I looked at his intelligent forehead, furrowed with
  5661	premature wrinkles, produced probably by misfortune and sorrow.  I
  5662	tried to learn the secret of his life from the last words that escaped
  5663	his lips.
  5664	
  5665	"You can go now, M. Aronnax," said the Captain.
  5666	
  5667	I left him in the dying man's cabin, and returned to my room much
  5668	affected by this scene.  During the whole day, I was haunted by
  5669	uncomfortable suspicions, and at night I slept badly, and between my
  5670	broken dreams I fancied I heard distant sighs like the notes of a
  5671	funeral psalm.  Were they the prayers of the dead, murmured in that
  5672	language that I could not understand?
  5673	
  5674	The next morning I went on to the bridge.  Captain Nemo was there
  5675	before me.  As soon as he perceived me he came to me.
  5676	
  5677	"Professor, will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion
  5678	to-day?"
  5679	
  5680	"With my companions?"  I asked.
  5681	
  5682	"If they like."
  5683	
  5684	"We obey your orders, Captain."
  5685	
  5686	"Will you be so good then as to put on your cork jackets?"
  5687	
  5688	It was not a question of dead or dying.  I rejoined Ned Land and
  5689	Conseil, and told them of Captain Nemo's proposition.  Conseil hastened
  5690	to accept it, and this time the Canadian seemed quite willing to follow
  5691	our example.
  5692	
  5693	It was eight o'clock in the morning.  At half-past eight we were
  5694	equipped for this new excursion, and provided with two contrivances for
  5695	light and breathing.  The double door was open; and, accompanied by
  5696	Captain Nemo, who was followed by a dozen of the crew, we set foot, at
  5697	a depth of about thirty feet, on the solid bottom on which the Nautilus
  5698	rested.
  5699	
  5700	A slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth.
  5701	This bottom differed entirely from the one I had visited on my first
  5702	excursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean.  Here, there was no
  5703	fine sand, no submarine prairies, no sea-forest. I immediately
  5704	recognised that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captain
  5705	did the honours to us.  It was the coral kingdom.
  5706	
  5707	The light produced a thousand charming varieties, playing in the midst
  5708	of the branches that were so vividly coloured.  I seemed to see the
  5709	membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the
  5710	waters.  I was tempted to gather their fresh petals, ornamented with
  5711	delicate tentacles, some just blown, the others budding, while a small
  5712	fish, swimming swiftly, touched them slightly, like flights of birds.
  5713	But if my hand approached these living flowers, these animated,
  5714	sensitive plants, the whole colony took alarm.  The white petals
  5715	re-entered their red cases, the flowers faded as I looked, and the bush
  5716	changed into a block of stony knobs.
  5717	
  5718	Chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of the
  5719	zoophyte.  This coral was more valuable than that found in the
  5720	Mediterranean, on the coasts of France, Italy and Barbary.  Its tints
  5721	justified the poetical names of "Flower of Blood," and "Froth of
  5722	Blood," that trade has given to its most beautiful productions.  Coral
  5723	is sold for L20 per ounce; and in this place the watery beds would make
  5724	the fortunes of a company of coral-divers. This precious matter, often
  5725	confused with other polypi, formed then the inextricable plots called
  5726	"macciota," and on which I noticed several beautiful specimens of pink
  5727	coral.
  5728	
  5729	But soon the bushes contract, and the arborisations increase. Real
  5730	petrified thickets, long joints of fantastic architecture, were
  5731	disclosed before us. Captain Nemo placed himself under a dark gallery,
  5732	where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of a hundred yards. The
  5733	light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects, following the
  5734	rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like
  5735	lustres, that were tipped with points of fire.
  5736	
  5737	At last, after walking two hours, we had attained a depth of about
  5738	three hundred yards, that is to say, the extreme limit on which coral
  5739	begins to form.  But there was no isolated bush, nor modest brushwood,
  5740	at the bottom of lofty trees.  It was an immense forest of large
  5741	mineral vegetations, enormous petrified trees, united by garlands of
  5742	elegant sea-bindweed, all adorned with clouds and reflections.  We
  5743	passed freely under their high branches, lost in the shade of the waves.
  5744	
  5745	Captain Nemo had stopped.  I and my companions halted, and, turning
  5746	round, I saw his men were forming a semi-circle round their chief.
  5747	Watching attentively, I observed that four of them carried on their
  5748	shoulders an object of an oblong shape.
  5749	
  5750	We occupied, in this place, the centre of a vast glade surrounded by
  5751	the lofty foliage of the submarine forest.  Our lamps threw over this
  5752	place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on
  5753	the ground.  At the end of the glade the darkness increased, and was
  5754	only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral.
  5755	
  5756	Ned Land and Conseil were near me.  We watched, and I thought I was
  5757	going to witness a strange scene.  On observing the ground, I saw that
  5758	it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with
  5759	limy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of
  5760	man.
  5761	
  5762	In the midst of the glade, on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up,
  5763	stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have
  5764	thought were made of petrified blood.  Upon a sign from Captain Nemo
  5765	one of the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to
  5766	dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt.  I understood
  5767	all!  This glade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object
  5768	the body of the man who had died in the night!  The Captain and his men
  5769	had come to bury their companion in this general resting-place, at the
  5770	bottom of this inaccessible ocean!
  5771	
  5772	The grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while their
  5773	retreat was being thus disturbed; I heard the strokes of the pickaxe,
  5774	which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the
  5775	waters.  The hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body.
  5776	Then the bearers approached; the body, enveloped in a tissue of white
  5777	linen, was lowered into the damp grave.  Captain Nemo, with his arms
  5778	crossed on his breast, and all the friends of him who had loved them,
  5779	knelt in prayer.
  5780	
  5781	The grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground,
  5782	which formed a slight mound.  When this was done, Captain Nemo and his
  5783	men rose; then, approaching the grave, they knelt again, and all
  5784	extended their hands in sign of a last adieu.  Then the funeral
  5785	procession returned to the Nautilus, passing under the arches of the
  5786	forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on
  5787	the ascent.  At last the light of the ship appeared, and its luminous
  5788	track guided us to the Nautilus.  At one o'clock we had returned.
  5789	
  5790	As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the platform, and,
  5791	a prey to conflicting emotions, I sat down near the binnacle.  Captain
  5792	Nemo joined me.  I rose and said to him:
  5793	
  5794	"So, as I said he would, this man died in the night?"
  5795	
  5796	"Yes, M. Aronnax."
  5797	
  5798	"And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?"
  5799	
  5800	"Yes, forgotten by all else, but not by us.  We dug the grave, and the
  5801	polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity." And, burying his face
  5802	quickly in his hands, he tried in vain to suppress a sob.  Then he
  5803	added:  "Our peaceful cemetery is there, some hundred feet below the
  5804	surface of the waves."
  5805	
  5806	"Your dead sleep quietly, at least, Captain, out of the reach of
  5807	sharks."
  5808	
  5809	"Yes, sir, of sharks and men," gravely replied the Captain.
  5810	
  5811	
  5812	
  5813	PART TWO
  5814	
  5815	
  5816	
  5817	CHAPTER I
  5818	
  5819	THE INDIAN OCEAN
  5820	
  5821	We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea.  The first
  5822	ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a
  5823	deep impression on my mind.  Thus, in the midst of this great sea,
  5824	Captain Nemo's life was passing, even to his grave, which he had
  5825	prepared in one of its deepest abysses.  There, not one of the ocean's
  5826	monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the Nautilus, of
  5827	those friends riveted to each other in death as in life.  "Nor any man,
  5828	either," had added the Captain.  Still the same fierce, implacable
  5829	defiance towards human society!
  5830	
  5831	I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied
  5832	Conseil.
  5833	
  5834	That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the Nautilus
  5835	one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt for
  5836	indifference.  For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of
  5837	earth's deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where
  5838	he might follow his instincts freely.  To my mind, this explains but
  5839	one side of Captain Nemo's character.  Indeed, the mystery of that last
  5840	night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the
  5841	precaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes
  5842	the glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the
  5843	man, due to an unaccountable shock of the Nautilus, all put me on a new
  5844	track.  No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man.  His
  5845	formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but
  5846	perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.
  5847	
  5848	At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light
  5849	amidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events
  5850	shall dictate.
  5851	
  5852	That day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, the second officer came
  5853	to take the altitude of the sun.  I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,
  5854	and watched the operation.  It seemed to me that the man did not
  5855	understand French; for several times I made remarks in a loud voice,
  5856	which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention, if
  5857	he had understood them; but he remained undisturbed and dumb.
  5858	
  5859	As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of
  5860	the Nautilus (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first
  5861	submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the glasses
  5862	of the lantern.  I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength
  5863	of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings, placed
  5864	similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance
  5865	in a horizontal plane.  The electric lamp was combined in such a way as
  5866	to give its most powerful light.  Indeed, it was produced in vacuo,
  5867	which insured both its steadiness and its intensity.  This vacuum
  5868	economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was
  5869	developed--an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could
  5870	not easily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste
  5871	was imperceptible.  When the Nautilus was ready to continue its
  5872	submarine journey, I went down to the saloon.  The panel was closed,
  5873	and the course marked direct west.
  5874	
  5875	We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain,
  5876	with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear
  5877	and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy.  The
  5878	Nautilus usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep.  We
  5879	went on so for some days.  To anyone but myself, who had a great love
  5880	for the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the
  5881	daily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air
  5882	of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the
  5883	saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up
  5884	all my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.
  5885	
  5886	For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or
  5887	gulls.  Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made
  5888	very acceptable water-game. Amongst large-winged birds, carried a long
  5889	distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of
  5890	their flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant
  5891	cries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of
  5892	the long-wings.
  5893	
  5894	As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised
  5895	the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels.  I saw many
  5896	kinds which I never before had a chance of observing.
  5897	
  5898	I shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian
  5899	Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. These
  5900	fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the
  5901	Crustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor
  5902	stony, but real bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, in
  5903	others of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular I saw some an inch
  5904	and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour;
  5905	they are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and I recommend
  5906	their introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of
  5907	sea-fish easily accustom themselves. I would also mention quadrangular
  5908	ostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over
  5909	with white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed
  5910	like birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of
  5911	their bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called
  5912	"seapigs"; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone,
  5913	whose flesh is very tough and leathery.
  5914	
  5915	I now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. "Certain fish of
  5916	the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white
  5917	chests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal
  5918	filaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the
  5919	liveliest colours.  Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides,
  5920	resembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and
  5921	without tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and
  5922	capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling
  5923	with darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with
  5924	lengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and
  5925	formed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot
  5926	into the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of
  5927	shell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long,
  5928	and bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with
  5929	rugged heads; and plenty of chaetpdons, with long and tubular muzzles,
  5930	which kill insects by shooting them, as from an air-gun, with a single
  5931	drop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas.
  5932	
  5933	"In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to
  5934	the second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and
  5935	bronchial membranes, I remarked the scorpaena, the head of which is
  5936	furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin; these
  5937	creatures are covered, or not, with little shells, according to the
  5938	sub-class to which they belong. The second sub-class gives us specimens
  5939	of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays,
  5940	and heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, it
  5941	gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately
  5942	called a 'seafrog,' with large head, sometimes pierced with holes,
  5943	sometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and
  5944	covered with tubercles; it has irregular and hideous horns; its body
  5945	and tail are covered with callosities; its sting makes a dangerous
  5946	wound; it is both repugnant and horrible to look at."
  5947	
  5948	From the 21st to the 23rd of January the Nautilus went at the rate of
  5949	two hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred
  5950	and forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour.  If we recognised so many
  5951	different varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric
  5952	light, they tried to follow us; the greater part, however, were soon
  5953	distanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of
  5954	the Nautilus for a time.  The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5' S.
  5955	lat., and 94° 33' long., we observed Keeling Island, a coral
  5956	formation, planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited
  5957	by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy.  The Nautilus skirted the shores of
  5958	this desert island for a little distance.  Its nets brought up numerous
  5959	specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca.  Some precious
  5960	productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of
  5961	Captain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of
  5962	parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell.
  5963	
  5964	Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was
  5965	directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.
  5966	
  5967	From Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often
  5968	taking us into great depths.  Several times they made use of the
  5969	inclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the
  5970	waterline.  In that way we went about two miles, but without ever
  5971	obtaining the greatest depths of the Indian Sea, which soundings of
  5972	seven thousand fathoms have never reached.  As to the temperature of
  5973	the lower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above
  5974	zero.  I only observed that in the upper regions the water was always
  5975	colder in the high levels than at the surface of the sea.
  5976	
  5977	On the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the Nautilus
  5978	passed the day on the surface, beating the waves with its powerful
  5979	screw and making them rebound to a great height.  Who under such
  5980	circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean?  Three
  5981	parts of this day I spent on the platform.  I watched the sea.  Nothing
  5982	on the horizon, till about four o'clock a steamer running west on our
  5983	counter.  Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see
  5984	the Nautilus, being too low in the water.  I fancied this steamboat
  5985	belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney,
  5986	touching at King George's Point and Melbourne.
  5987	
  5988	At five o'clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which
  5989	binds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by
  5990	a curious spectacle.
  5991	
  5992	It was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the
  5993	ocean.  We could count several hundreds.  They belonged to the tubercle
  5994	kind which are peculiar to the Indian seas.
  5995	
  5996	These graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive
  5997	tube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in.  Of
  5998	their eight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating
  5999	on the water, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the
  6000	wing like a light sail.  I saw their spiral-shaped and fluted shells,
  6001	which Cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff.  A boat indeed!  It
  6002	bears the creature which secretes it without its adhering to it.
  6003	
  6004	For nearly an hour the Nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of
  6005	molluscs.  Then I know not what sudden fright they took.  But as if at
  6006	a signal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, the
  6007	shells turned over, changing their centre of gravity, and the whole
  6008	fleet disappeared under the waves.  Never did the ships of a squadron
  6009	manoeuvre with more unity.
  6010	
  6011	At that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by
  6012	the breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the Nautilus.
  6013	
  6014	The next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty-second
  6015	meridian and entered the northern hemisphere.  During the day a
  6016	formidable troop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, which
  6017	multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous.  They were
  6018	"cestracio philippi" sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies,
  6019	armed with eleven rows of teeth--eyed sharks--their throat being marked
  6020	with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye.  There were
  6021	also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots.
  6022	These powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the
  6023	saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure.  At such
  6024	times Ned Land was no longer master of himself.  He wanted to go to the
  6025	surface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound
  6026	sharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large
  6027	tiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to
  6028	excite him more particularly.  But the Nautilus, accelerating her
  6029	speed, easily left the most rapid of them behind.
  6030	
  6031	The 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met
  6032	repeatedly a forbidding spectacle, dead bodies floating on the surface
  6033	of the water.  They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by
  6034	the Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only
  6035	undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour.  But the
  6036	sharks did not fail to help them at their funeral work.
  6037	
  6038	About seven o'clock in the evening, the Nautilus, half-immersed, was
  6039	sailing in a sea of milk.  At first sight the ocean seemed lactified.
  6040	Was it the effect of the lunar rays?  No; for the moon, scarcely two
  6041	days old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the
  6042	sun.  The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by
  6043	contrast with the whiteness of the waters.
  6044	
  6045	Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the cause
  6046	of this strange phenomenon.  Happily I was able to answer him.
  6047	
  6048	"It is called a milk sea," I explained.  "A large extent of white
  6049	wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts
  6050	of the sea."
  6051	
  6052	"But, sir," said Conseil, "can you tell me what causes such an effect?
  6053	for I suppose the water is not really turned into milk."
  6054	
  6055	"No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by
  6056	the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm,
  6057	gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose
  6058	length is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch.  These insects
  6059	adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues."
  6060	
  6061	"Several leagues!" exclaimed Conseil.
  6062	
  6063	"Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these
  6064	infusoria.  You will not be able, for, if I am not mistaken, ships have
  6065	floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles."
  6066	
  6067	Towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour; but behind
  6068	us, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened
  6069	waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague
  6070	glimmerings of an aurora borealis.
  6071

  6074	CHAPTER II
  6075	
  6076	A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S
  6077	
  6078	On the 28th of February, when at noon the Nautilus came to the surface
  6079	of the sea, in 9° 4' N. lat., there was land in sight about eight
  6080	miles to westward.  The first thing I noticed was a range of mountains
  6081	about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most capricious.
  6082	On taking the bearings, I knew that we were nearing the island of
  6083	Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian Peninsula.
  6084	
  6085	Captain Nemo and his second appeared at this moment.  The Captain
  6086	glanced at the map.  Then turning to me, said:
  6087	
  6088	"The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. Would you like to
  6089	visit one of them, M. Aronnax?"
  6090	
  6091	"Certainly, Captain."
  6092	
  6093	"Well, the thing is easy.  Though, if we see the fisheries, we shall
  6094	not see the fishermen.  The annual exportation has not yet begun.
  6095	Never mind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where we
  6096	shall arrive in the night."
  6097	
  6098	The Captain said something to his second, who immediately went out.
  6099	Soon the Nautilus returned to her native element, and the manometer
  6100	showed that she was about thirty feet deep.
  6101	
  6102	"Well, sir," said Captain Nemo, "you and your companions shall visit
  6103	the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we
  6104	shall see him at work."
  6105	
  6106	"Agreed, Captain!"
  6107	
  6108	"By the bye, M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks?"
  6109	
  6110	"Sharks!" exclaimed I.
  6111	
  6112	This question seemed a very hard one.
  6113	
  6114	"Well?" continued Captain Nemo.
  6115	
  6116	"I admit, Captain, that I am not yet very familiar with that kind of
  6117	fish."
  6118	
  6119	"We are accustomed to them," replied Captain Nemo, "and in time you
  6120	will be too.  However, we shall be armed, and on the road we may be
  6121	able to hunt some of the tribe.  It is interesting.  So, till
  6122	to-morrow, sir, and early."
  6123	
  6124	This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon.  Now, if
  6125	you were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what
  6126	would you say?
  6127	
  6128	"Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear." If you were asked
  6129	to hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian
  6130	jungles, what would you say?
  6131	
  6132	"Ha! ha! it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!" But when
  6133	you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element, you would
  6134	perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation.  As for myself, I
  6135	passed my hand over my forehead, on which stood large drops of cold
  6136	perspiration.  "Let us reflect," said I, "and take our time.  Hunting
  6137	otters in submarine forests, as we did in the Island of Crespo, will
  6138	pass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is
  6139	almost certain to meet sharks, is quite another thing!  I know well
  6140	that in certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the
  6141	negroes never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a
  6142	running noose in the other; but I also know that few who affront those
  6143	creatures ever return alive.  However, I am not a negro, and if I were
  6144	I think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed."
  6145	
  6146	At this moment Conseil and the Canadian entered, quite composed, and
  6147	even joyous.  They knew not what awaited them.
  6148	
  6149	"Faith, sir," said Ned Land, "your Captain Nemo--the devil take
  6150	him!--has just made us a very pleasant offer."
  6151	
  6152	"Ah!" said I, "you know?"
  6153	
  6154	"If agreeable to you, sir," interrupted Conseil, "the commander of the
  6155	Nautilus has invited us to visit the magnificent Ceylon fisheries
  6156	to-morrow, in your company; he did it kindly, and behaved like a real
  6157	gentleman."
  6158	
  6159	"He said nothing more?"
  6160	
  6161	"Nothing more, sir, except that he had already spoken to you of this
  6162	little walk."
  6163	
  6164	"Sir," said Conseil, "would you give us some details of the pearl
  6165	fishery?"
  6166	
  6167	"As to the fishing itself," I asked, "or the incidents, which?"
  6168	
  6169	"On the fishing," replied the Canadian; "before entering upon the
  6170	ground, it is as well to know something about it."
  6171	
  6172	"Very well; sit down, my friends, and I will teach you."
  6173	
  6174	Ned and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and the first thing
  6175	the Canadian asked was:
  6176	
  6177	"Sir, what is a pearl?"
  6178	
  6179	"My worthy Ned," I answered, "to the poet, a pearl is a tear of the
  6180	sea; to the Orientals, it is a drop of dew solidified; to the ladies,
  6181	it is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl
  6182	substance, which they wear on their fingers, their necks, or their
  6183	ears; for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of
  6184	lime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, it is simply
  6185	a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl
  6186	amongst certain bivalves."
  6187	
  6188	"Branch of molluscs," said Conseil.
  6189	
  6190	"Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the
  6191	earshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which
  6192	secrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white
  6193	substance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of
  6194	producing pearls."
  6195	
  6196	"Mussels too?" asked the Canadian.
  6197	
  6198	"Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony,
  6199	Bohemia, and France."
  6200	
  6201	"Good!  For the future I shall pay attention," replied the Canadian.
  6202	
  6203	"But," I continued, "the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is
  6204	the pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritiferct, that precious
  6205	pintadine. The pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in
  6206	a globular form, either adhering to the oyster shell, or buried in the
  6207	folds of the creature. On the shell it is fast; in the flesh it is
  6208	loose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a
  6209	barren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which the pearly matter
  6210	deposits itself year after year successively, and by thin concentric
  6211	layers."
  6212	
  6213	"Are many pearls found in the same oyster?" asked Conseil.
  6214	
  6215	"Yes, my boy.  Some are a perfect casket.  One oyster has been
  6216	mentioned, though I allow myself to doubt it, as having contained no
  6217	less than a hundred and fifty sharks."
  6218	
  6219	"A hundred and fifty sharks!" exclaimed Ned Land.
  6220	
  6221	"Did I say sharks?" said I hurriedly.  "I meant to say a hundred and
  6222	fifty pearls.  Sharks would not be sense."
  6223	
  6224	"Certainly not," said Conseil; "but will you tell us now by what means
  6225	they extract these pearls?"
  6226	
  6227	"They proceed in various ways.  When they adhere to the shell, the
  6228	fishermen often pull them off with pincers; but the most common way is
  6229	to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks.  Thus
  6230	they die in the open air; and at the end of ten days they are in a
  6231	forward state of decomposition.  They are then plunged into large
  6232	reservoirs of sea-water; then they are opened and washed."
  6233	
  6234	"The price of these pearls varies according to their size?" asked
  6235	Conseil.
  6236	
  6237	"Not only according to their size," I answered, "but also according to
  6238	their shape, their water (that is, their colour), and their lustre:
  6239	that is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming
  6240	to the eye.  The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.
  6241	They are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often
  6242	opaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; they are
  6243	generally round or oval.  The round are made into bracelets, the oval
  6244	into pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly.  Those
  6245	adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and
  6246	are sold by weight.  Lastly, in a lower order are classed those small
  6247	pearls known under the name of seed-pearls; they are sold by measure,
  6248	and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments."
  6249	
  6250	"But," said Conseil, "is this pearl-fishery dangerous?"
  6251	
  6252	"No," I answered, quickly; "particularly if certain precautions are
  6253	taken."
  6254	
  6255	"What does one risk in such a calling?" said Ned Land, "the swallowing
  6256	of some mouthfuls of sea-water?"
  6257	
  6258	"As you say, Ned.  By the bye," said I, trying to take Captain Nemo's
  6259	careless tone, "are you afraid of sharks, brave Ned?"
  6260	
  6261	"I!" replied the Canadian; "a harpooner by profession?  It is my trade
  6262	to make light of them."
  6263	
  6264	"But," said I, "it is not a question of fishing for them with an
  6265	iron-swivel, hoisting them into the vessel, cutting off their tails
  6266	with a blow of a chopper, ripping them up, and throwing their heart
  6267	into the sea!"
  6268	
  6269	"Then, it is a question of----"
  6270	
  6271	"Precisely."
  6272	
  6273	"In the water?"
  6274	
  6275	"In the water."
  6276	
  6277	"Faith, with a good harpoon!  You know, sir, these sharks are
  6278	ill-fashioned beasts.  They turn on their bellies to seize you, and in
  6279	that time----"
  6280	
  6281	Ned Land had a way of saying "seize" which made my blood run cold.
  6282	
  6283	"Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks?"
  6284	
  6285	"Me!" said Conseil.  "I will be frank, sir."
  6286	
  6287	"So much the better," thought I.
  6288	
  6289	"If you, sir, mean to face the sharks, I do not see why your faithful
  6290	servant should not face them with you."
  6291	
  6292	
  6293	
  6294	CHAPTER III
  6295	
  6296	A PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS
  6297	
  6298	The next morning at four o'clock I was awakened by the steward whom
  6299	Captain Nemo had placed at my service.  I rose hurriedly, dressed, and
  6300	went into the saloon.
  6301	
  6302	Captain Nemo was awaiting me.
  6303	
  6304	"M. Aronnax," said he, "are you ready to start?"
  6305	
  6306	"I am ready."
  6307	
  6308	"Then please to follow me."
  6309	
  6310	"And my companions, Captain?"
  6311	
  6312	"They have been told and are waiting."
  6313	
  6314	"Are we not to put on our diver's dresses?" asked I.
  6315	
  6316	"Not yet.  I have not allowed the Nautilus to come too near this coast,
  6317	and we are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but the boat is ready,
  6318	and will take us to the exact point of disembarking, which will save us
  6319	a long way.  It carries our diving apparatus, which we will put on when
  6320	we begin our submarine journey."
  6321	
  6322	Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the
  6323	platform.  Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of
  6324	the "pleasure party" which was preparing.  Five sailors from the
  6325	Nautilus, with their oars, waited in the boat, which had been made fast
  6326	against the side.
  6327	
  6328	The night was still dark.  Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing
  6329	but few stars to be seen.  I looked on the side where the land lay, and
  6330	saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from
  6331	south-west to north west.  The Nautilus, having returned during the
  6332	night up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or
  6333	rather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar.  There,
  6334	under the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible
  6335	field of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles.
  6336	
  6337	Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I took our places in the stern of
  6338	the boat.  The master went to the tiller; his four companions leaned on
  6339	their oars, the painter was cast off, and we sheered off.
  6340	
  6341	The boat went towards the south; the oarsmen did not hurry.  I noticed
  6342	that their strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every
  6343	ten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy.
  6344	Whilst the craft was running by its own velocity, the liquid drops
  6345	struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead.
  6346	A little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to the boat, and
  6347	some samphire reeds flapped before it.
  6348	
  6349	We were silent.  What was Captain Nemo thinking of?  Perhaps of the
  6350	land he was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary
  6351	to the Canadian's opinion, who thought it too far off.  As to Conseil,
  6352	he was merely there from curiosity.
  6353	
  6354	About half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper
  6355	line of coast more distinctly.  Flat enough in the east, it rose a
  6356	little to the south.  Five miles still lay between us, and it was
  6357	indistinct owing to the mist on the water.  At six o'clock it became
  6358	suddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions,
  6359	which know neither dawn nor twilight.  The solar rays pierced the
  6360	curtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb
  6361	rose rapidly.  I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here
  6362	and there.  The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the
  6363	south.  Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea.
  6364	
  6365	At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran,
  6366	for it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the
  6367	highest points of the bank of pintadines.
  6368	
  6369	"Here we are, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "You see that enclosed
  6370	bay?  Here, in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of
  6371	the exporters, and these are the waters their divers will ransack so
  6372	boldly.  Happily, this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing.
  6373	It is sheltered from the strongest winds; the sea is never very rough
  6374	here, which makes it favourable for the diver's work.  We will now put
  6375	on our dresses, and begin our walk."
  6376	
  6377	I did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with
  6378	the help of the sailors to put on my heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and
  6379	my companions were also dressing.  None of the Nautilus men were to
  6380	accompany us on this new excursion.
  6381	
  6382	Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air
  6383	apparatus fixed to our backs by braces.  As to the Ruhmkorff apparatus,
  6384	there was no necessity for it.  Before putting my head into the copper
  6385	cap, I had asked the question of the Captain.
  6386	
  6387	"They would be useless," he replied.  "We are going to no great depth,
  6388	and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk.  Besides, it would
  6389	not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters; its
  6390	brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast
  6391	most inopportunely."
  6392	
  6393	As Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned
  6394	Land.  But my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal
  6395	cap, and they could neither hear nor answer.
  6396	
  6397	One last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo.
  6398	
  6399	"And our arms?" asked I; "our guns?"
  6400	
  6401	"Guns!  What for?  Do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in
  6402	their hand, and is not steel surer than lead?  Here is a strong blade;
  6403	put it in your belt, and we start."
  6404	
  6405	I looked at my companions; they were armed like us, and, more than
  6406	that, Ned Land was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which he had placed
  6407	in the boat before leaving the Nautilus.
  6408	
  6409	Then, following the Captain's example, I allowed myself to be dressed
  6410	in the heavy copper helmet, and our reservoirs of air were at once in
  6411	activity.  An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in
  6412	about two yards of water upon an even sand.  Captain Nemo made a sign
  6413	with his hand, and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we
  6414	disappeared under the waves.
  6415	
  6416	Over our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, rose shoals of fish, of
  6417	the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail. I
  6418	recognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a
  6419	livid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a
  6420	conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the
  6421	genus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, I saw some of
  6422	the most brilliant colours, carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe; an
  6423	excellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name
  6424	of Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus
  6425	apsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight
  6426	longitudinal plates.
  6427	
  6428	The heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil
  6429	changed by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of
  6430	boulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the
  6431	specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal
  6432	shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian
  6433	Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and
  6434	a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready
  6435	to seize one. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and
  6436	lastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the
  6437	richest vegetations of these seas.
  6438	
  6439	In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the
  6440	hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some
  6441	raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some
  6442	horrible looking parthenopes.
  6443	
  6444	At about seven o'clock we found ourselves at last surveying the
  6445	oyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions.
  6446	
  6447	Captain Nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and
  6448	I could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature's
  6449	creative power is far beyond man's instinct of destruction.  Ned Land,
  6450	faithful to his instinct, hastened to fill a net which he carried by
  6451	his side with some of the finest specimens.  But we could not stop.  We
  6452	must follow the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known
  6453	only to himself.  The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on
  6454	holding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea.  Then the level
  6455	of the bank would sink capriciously.  Often we rounded high rocks
  6456	scarped into pyramids.  In their dark fractures huge crustacea, perched
  6457	upon their high claws like some war-machine, watched us with fixed
  6458	eyes, and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides.
  6459	
  6460	At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a
  6461	picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the
  6462	submarine flora.  At first it seemed very dark to me.  The solar rays
  6463	seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague
  6464	transparency became nothing more than drowned light.  Captain Nemo
  6465	entered; we followed.  My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this
  6466	relative state of darkness.  I could distinguish the arches springing
  6467	capriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite
  6468	base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture.  Why had our
  6469	incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt?  I
  6470	was soon to know.  After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet
  6471	trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit.  There Captain Nemo stopped,
  6472	and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived.  It was
  6473	an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet
  6474	which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the
  6475	breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently
  6476	larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the Nautilus.  I approached
  6477	this extraordinary mollusc.  It adhered by its filaments to a table of
  6478	granite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of
  6479	the grotto.  I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lb.  Such
  6480	an oyster would contain 30 lb. of meat; and one must have the stomach
  6481	of a Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.
  6482	
  6483	Captain Nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this
  6484	bivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual
  6485	state of this tridacne.  The shells were a little open; the Captain
  6486	came near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then
  6487	with his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which
  6488	formed a cloak for the creature.  There, between the folded plaits, I
  6489	saw a loose pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular
  6490	shape, perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a
  6491	jewel of inestimable value.  Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched
  6492	out my hand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain
  6493	stopped me, made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger,
  6494	and the two shells closed suddenly.  I then understood Captain Nemo's
  6495	intention.  In leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne
  6496	he was allowing it to grow slowly.  Each year the secretions of the
  6497	mollusc would add new concentric circles.  I estimated its value at
  6498	L500,000 at least.
  6499	
  6500	After ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  I thought he had
  6501	halted previously to returning.  No; by a gesture he bade us crouch
  6502	beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part
  6503	of the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.
  6504	
  6505	About five yards from me a shadow appeared, and sank to the ground.
  6506	The disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was
  6507	mistaken; and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had
  6508	anything to do with.
  6509	
  6510	It was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I
  6511	suppose, had come to glean before the harvest.  I could see the bottom
  6512	of his canoe anchored some feet above his head.  He dived and went up
  6513	successively.  A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a
  6514	sugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to
  6515	descend more rapidly.  This was all his apparatus.  Reaching the
  6516	bottom, about five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag
  6517	with oysters picked up at random.  Then he went up, emptied it, pulled
  6518	up his stone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty
  6519	seconds.
  6520	
  6521	The diver did not see us.  The shadow of the rock hid us from sight.
  6522	And how should this poor Indian ever dream that men, beings like
  6523	himself, should be there under the water watching his movements and
  6524	losing no detail of the fishing?  Several times he went up in this way,
  6525	and dived again.  He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge,
  6526	for he was obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by
  6527	means of their strong byssus.  And how many of those oysters for which
  6528	he risked his life had no pearl in them!  I watched him closely; his
  6529	manoeuvres were regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger
  6530	appeared to threaten him.
  6531	
  6532	I was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting
  6533	fishing, when suddenly, as the Indian was on the ground, I saw him make
  6534	a gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface
  6535	of the sea.
  6536	
  6537	I understood his dread.  A gigantic shadow appeared just above the
  6538	unfortunate diver.  It was a shark of enormous size advancing
  6539	diagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open.  I was mute with
  6540	horror and unable to move.
  6541	
  6542	The voracious creature shot towards the Indian, who threw himself on
  6543	one side to avoid the shark's fins; but not its tail, for it struck his
  6544	chest and stretched him on the ground.
  6545	
  6546	This scene lasted but a few seconds:  the shark returned, and, turning
  6547	on his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw
  6548	Captain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to
  6549	the monster, ready to fight face to face with him.  The very moment the
  6550	shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two, he perceived his
  6551	new adversary, and, turning over, made straight towards him.
  6552	
  6553	I can still see Captain Nemo's position.  Holding himself well
  6554	together, he waited for the shark with admirable coolness; and, when it
  6555	rushed at him, threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness,
  6556	avoiding the shock, and burying his dagger deep into its side.  But it
  6557	was not all over.  A terrible combat ensued.
  6558	
  6559	The shark had seemed to roar, if I might say so.  The blood rushed in
  6560	torrents from its wound.  The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque
  6561	liquid I could distinguish nothing more.  Nothing more until the moment
  6562	when, like lightning, I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of
  6563	the creature's fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with the
  6564	monster, and dealing successive blows at his enemy, yet still unable to
  6565	give a decisive one.
  6566	
  6567	The shark's struggles agitated the water with such fury that the
  6568	rocking threatened to upset me.
  6569	
  6570	I wanted to go to the Captain's assistance, but, nailed to the spot
  6571	with horror, I could not stir.
  6572	
  6573	I saw the haggard eye; I saw the different phases of the fight.  The
  6574	Captain fell to the earth, upset by the enormous mass which leant upon
  6575	him.  The shark's jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and
  6576	it would have been all over with the Captain; but, quick as thought,
  6577	harpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards the shark and struck it with
  6578	its sharp point.
  6579	
  6580	The waves were impregnated with a mass of blood.  They rocked under the
  6581	shark's movements, which beat them with indescribable fury.  Ned Land
  6582	had not missed his aim.  It was the monster's death-rattle.  Struck to
  6583	the heart, it struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which
  6584	overthrew Conseil.
  6585	
  6586	But Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any
  6587	wound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held him
  6588	to his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,
  6589	mounted to the surface.
  6590	
  6591	We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached
  6592	the fisherman's boat.
  6593	
  6594	Captain Nemo's first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life
  6595	again.  I did not think he could succeed.  I hoped so, for the poor
  6596	creature's immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark's tail
  6597	might have been his death-blow.
  6598	
  6599	Happily, with the Captain's and Conseil's sharp friction, I saw
  6600	consciousness return by degrees.  He opened his eyes.  What was his
  6601	surprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning
  6602	over him!  And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,
  6603	drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his
  6604	hand!  This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor
  6605	Cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand.  His wondering eyes
  6606	showed that he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune
  6607	and life.
  6608	
  6609	At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the
  6610	road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which
  6611	held the canoe of the Nautilus to the earth.
  6612	
  6613	Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the
  6614	heavy copper helmet.
  6615	
  6616	Captain Nemo's first word was to the Canadian.
  6617	
  6618	"Thank you, Master Land," said he.
  6619	
  6620	"It was in revenge, Captain," replied Ned Land.  "I owed you that."
  6621	
  6622	A ghastly smile passed across the Captain's lips, and that was all.
  6623	
  6624	"To the Nautilus," said he.
  6625	
  6626	The boat flew over the waves.  Some minutes after we met the shark's
  6627	dead body floating.  By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,
  6628	I recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the
  6629	species of shark so properly called.  It was more than twenty-five feet
  6630	long; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body.  It was an
  6631	adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles
  6632	triangle in the upper jaw.
  6633	
  6634	Whilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious
  6635	beasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw
  6636	themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the
  6637	pieces.
  6638	
  6639	At half-past eight we were again on board the Nautilus.  There I
  6640	reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to
  6641	the Manaar Bank.
  6642	
  6643	Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it--one bearing upon the
  6644	unparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a
  6645	human being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath
  6646	the sea.  Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded
  6647	in entirely crushing his heart.
  6648	
  6649	When I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved
  6650	tone:
  6651	
  6652	"That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am
  6653	still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!"
  6654	
  6655	
  6656	
  6657	CHAPTER IV
  6658	
  6659	THE RED SEA
  6660	
  6661	In the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon
  6662	disappeared under the horizon, and the Nautilus, at a speed of twenty
  6663	miles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the
  6664	Maldives from the Laccadives.  It coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a
  6665	land originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one
  6666	of the nineteen principal islands of the Laccadive Archipelago,
  6667	situated between 10° and 14° 30' N. lat., and 69° 50' 72"
  6668	E. long.
  6669	
  6670	We had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from our
  6671	starting-point in the Japanese Seas.
  6672	
  6673	The next day (30th January), when the Nautilus went to the surface of
  6674	the ocean there was no land in sight.  Its course was N.N.E., in the
  6675	direction of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula,
  6676	which serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf.  It was evidently a
  6677	block without any possible egress.  Where was Captain Nemo taking us
  6678	to?  I could not say.  This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who
  6679	that day came to me asking where we were going.
  6680	
  6681	"We are going where our Captain's fancy takes us, Master Ned."
  6682	
  6683	"His fancy cannot take us far, then," said the Canadian.  "The Persian
  6684	Gulf has no outlet:  and, if we do go in, it will not be long before we
  6685	are out again."
  6686	
  6687	"Very well, then, we will come out again, Master Land; and if, after
  6688	the Persian Gulf, the Nautilus would like to visit the Red Sea, the
  6689	Straits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give us entrance."
  6690	
  6691	"I need not tell you, sir," said Ned Land, "that the Red Sea is as much
  6692	closed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it
  6693	was, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut
  6694	with sluices.  And again, the Red Sea is not the road to take us back
  6695	to Europe."
  6696	
  6697	"But I never said we were going back to Europe."
  6698	
  6699	"What do you suppose, then?"
  6700	
  6701	"I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt,
  6702	the Nautilus will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the
  6703	Channel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the
  6704	Cape of Good Hope."
  6705	
  6706	"And once at the Cape of Good Hope?" asked the Canadian, with peculiar
  6707	emphasis.
  6708	
  6709	"Well, we shall penetrate into that Atlantic which we do not yet know.
  6710	Ah! friend Ned, you are getting tired of this journey under the sea;
  6711	you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine
  6712	wonders.  For my part, I shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage
  6713	which it is given to so few men to make."
  6714	
  6715	For four days, till the 3rd of February, the Nautilus scoured the Sea
  6716	of Oman, at various speeds and at various depths.  It seemed to go at
  6717	random, as if hesitating as to which road it should follow, but we
  6718	never passed the Tropic of Cancer.
  6719	
  6720	In quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most
  6721	important towns of the country of Oman.  I admired its strange aspect,
  6722	surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood
  6723	in relief.  I saw the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant points
  6724	of its minarets, its fresh and verdant terraces.  But it was only a
  6725	vision!  The Nautilus soon sank under the waves of that part of the sea.
  6726	
  6727	We passed along the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut, for a
  6728	distance of six miles, its undulating line of mountains being
  6729	occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin.  The 5th of February we at
  6730	last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the
  6731	neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red
  6732	Sea.
  6733	
  6734	The 6th of February, the Nautilus floated in sight of Aden, perched
  6735	upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind
  6736	of inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by
  6737	the English after taking possession in 1839.  I caught a glimpse of the
  6738	octagon minarets of this town, which was at one time the richest
  6739	commercial magazine on the coast.
  6740	
  6741	I certainly thought that Captain Nemo, arrived at this point, would
  6742	back out again; but I was mistaken, for he did no such thing, much to
  6743	my surprise.
  6744	
  6745	The next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of
  6746	Bab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of
  6747	Tears.
  6748	
  6749	To twenty miles in breadth, it is only thirty-two in length.  And for
  6750	the Nautilus, starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the
  6751	work of an hour.  But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with
  6752	which the British Government has fortified the position of Aden.  There
  6753	were too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay,
  6754	Calcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing
  6755	this narrow passage, for the Nautilus to venture to show itself.  So it
  6756	remained prudently below.  At last about noon, we were in the waters of
  6757	the Red Sea.
  6758	
  6759	I would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided
  6760	Captain Nemo upon entering the gulf.  But I quite approved of the
  6761	Nautilus entering it.  Its speed was lessened:  sometimes it kept on
  6762	the surface, sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel, and thus I was able
  6763	to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea.
  6764	
  6765	The 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight,
  6766	now a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which
  6767	shelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important
  6768	city, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose
  6769	walls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in
  6770	circumference.
  6771	
  6772	The Nautilus then approached the African shore, where the depth of the
  6773	sea was greater.  There, between two waters clear as crystal, through
  6774	the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful bushes of
  6775	brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a splendid fur of
  6776	green variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and algae
  6777	and fuci.  What an indescribable spectacle, and what variety of sites
  6778	and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic islands which bound
  6779	the Libyan coast!  But where these shrubs appeared in all their beauty
  6780	was on the eastern coast, which the Nautilus soon gained.  It was on
  6781	the coast of Tehama, for there not only did this display of zoophytes
  6782	flourish beneath the level of the sea, but they also formed picturesque
  6783	interlacings which unfolded themselves about sixty feet above the
  6784	surface, more capricious but less highly coloured than those whose
  6785	freshness was kept up by the vital power of the waters.
  6786	
  6787	What charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon!  What
  6788	new specimens of submarine flora and fauna did I admire under the
  6789	brightness of our electric lantern!
  6790	
  6791	The 9th of February the Nautilus floated in the broadest part of the
  6792	Red Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and
  6793	Komfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles.
  6794	
  6795	That day at noon, after the bearings were taken, Captain Nemo mounted
  6796	the platform, where I happened to be, and I was determined not to let
  6797	him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior
  6798	projects.  As soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me
  6799	a cigar.
  6800	
  6801	"Well, sir, does this Red Sea please you?  Have you sufficiently
  6802	observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its
  6803	parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral?  Did you catch a
  6804	glimpse of the towns on its borders?"
  6805	
  6806	"Yes, Captain Nemo," I replied; "and the Nautilus is wonderfully fitted
  6807	for such a study.  Ah! it is an intelligent boat!"
  6808	
  6809	"Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable.  It fears neither the terrible
  6810	tempests of the Red Sea, nor its currents, nor its sandbanks."
  6811	
  6812	"Certainly," said I, "this sea is quoted as one of the worst, and in
  6813	the time of the ancients, if I am not mistaken, its reputation was
  6814	detestable."
  6815	
  6816	"Detestable, M. Aronnax.  The Greek and Latin historians do not speak
  6817	favourably of it, and Strabo says it is very dangerous during the
  6818	Etesian winds and in the rainy season.  The Arabian Edrisi portrays it
  6819	under the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels
  6820	perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would
  6821	risk sailing in the night.  It is, he pretends, a sea subject to
  6822	fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and `which offers
  6823	nothing good either on its surface or in its depths.'"
  6824	
  6825	"One may see," I replied, "that these historians never sailed on board
  6826	the Nautilus."
  6827	
  6828	"Just so," replied the Captain, smiling; "and in that respect moderns
  6829	are not more advanced than the ancients.  It required many ages to find
  6830	out the mechanical power of steam.  Who knows if, in another hundred
  6831	years, we may not see a second Nautilus?  Progress is slow, M. Aronnax."
  6832	
  6833	"It is true," I answered; "your boat is at least a century before its
  6834	time, perhaps an era.  What a misfortune that the secret of such an
  6835	invention should die with its inventor!"
  6836	
  6837	Captain Nemo did not reply.  After some minutes' silence he continued:
  6838	
  6839	"You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the
  6840	dangerous navigation of the Red Sea."
  6841	
  6842	"It is true," said I; "but were not their fears exaggerated?"
  6843	
  6844	"Yes and no, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the
  6845	Red Sea by heart.  "That which is no longer dangerous for a modern
  6846	vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course,
  6847	thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of
  6848	the ancients.  Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in
  6849	ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated
  6850	with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin!  They
  6851	had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they
  6852	went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything.
  6853	Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous.
  6854	But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have
  6855	nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary
  6856	trade-winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their
  6857	departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return,
  6858	they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the
  6859	gods in the neighbouring temple."
  6860	
  6861	"I agree with you," said I; "and steam seems to have killed all
  6862	gratitude in the hearts of sailors.  But, Captain, since you seem to
  6863	have especially studied this sea, can you tell me the origin of its
  6864	name?"
  6865	
  6866	"There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax.  Would
  6867	you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?"
  6868	
  6869	"Willingly."
  6870	
  6871	"This fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the
  6872	passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which
  6873	closed at the voice of Moses."
  6874	
  6875	"A poet's explanation, Captain Nemo," I replied; "but I cannot content
  6876	myself with that.  I ask you for your personal opinion."
  6877	
  6878	"Here it is, M. Aronnax.  According to my idea, we must see in this
  6879	appellation of the Red Sea a translation of the Hebrew word `Edom'; and
  6880	if the ancients gave it that name, it was on account of the particular
  6881	colour of its waters."
  6882	
  6883	"But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and
  6884	without any particular colour."
  6885	
  6886	"Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see
  6887	this singular appearance.  I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely
  6888	red, like a sea of blood."
  6889	
  6890	"And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic
  6891	seaweed?"
  6892	
  6893	"Yes."
  6894	
  6895	"So, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have overrun the Red
  6896	Sea on board the Nautilus?"
  6897	
  6898	"No, sir."
  6899	
  6900	"As you spoke a while ago of the passage of the Israelites and of the
  6901	catastrophe to the Egyptians, I will ask whether you have met with the
  6902	traces under the water of this great historical fact?"
  6903	
  6904	"No, sir; and for a good reason."
  6905	
  6906	"What is it?"
  6907	
  6908	"It is that the spot where Moses and his people passed is now so
  6909	blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there.
  6910	You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my
  6911	Nautilus."
  6912	
  6913	"And the spot?"  I asked.
  6914	
  6915	"The spot is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm
  6916	which formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the
  6917	Salt Lakes.  Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the
  6918	Israelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and
  6919	Pharaoh's army perished precisely on that spot; and I think that
  6920	excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large
  6921	number of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin."
  6922	
  6923	"That is evident," I replied; "and for the sake of archaeologists let
  6924	us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new
  6925	towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the
  6926	Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the
  6927	Nautilus."
  6928	
  6929	"Very likely; but useful to the whole world," said Captain Nemo.  "The
  6930	ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the Red
  6931	Sea and the Mediterranean for their commercial affairs: but they did
  6932	not think of digging a canal direct, and took the Nile as an
  6933	intermediate.  Very probably the canal which united the Nile to the Red
  6934	Sea was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition.  One thing is
  6935	certain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the
  6936	works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the Nile across the plain
  6937	of Egypt, looking towards Arabia.  It took four days to go up this
  6938	canal, and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast.  It was
  6939	carried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by
  6940	Ptolemy II.  Strabo saw it navigated:  but its decline from the point
  6941	of departure, near Bubastes, to the Red Sea was so slight that it was
  6942	only navigable for a few months in the year.  This canal answered all
  6943	commercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when it was abandoned and
  6944	blocked up with sand.  Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, it was
  6945	definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to
  6946	prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had
  6947	revolted against him.  During the expedition into Egypt, your General
  6948	Bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and,
  6949	surprised by the tide, he nearly perished before regaining Hadjaroth,
  6950	at the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before
  6951	him."
  6952	
  6953	"Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction
  6954	between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,
  6955	M. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed
  6956	Africa into an immense island."
  6957	
  6958	"Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.
  6959	Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains.  He
  6960	began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has
  6961	triumphed, for he has the genius of will.  And it is sad to think that
  6962	a work like that, which ought to have been an international work and
  6963	which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have
  6964	succeeded by the energy of one man.  All honour to M. Lesseps!"
  6965	
  6966	"Yes! honour to the great citizen," I replied, surprised by the manner
  6967	in which Captain Nemo had just spoken.
  6968	
  6969	"Unfortunately," he continued, "I cannot take you through the Suez
  6970	Canal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after
  6971	to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean."
  6972	
  6973	"The Mediterranean!"  I exclaimed.
  6974	
  6975	"Yes, sir; does that astonish you?"
  6976	
  6977	"What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after
  6978	to-morrow."
  6979	
  6980	"Indeed?"
  6981	
  6982	"Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself
  6983	to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat."
  6984	
  6985	"But the cause of this surprise?"
  6986	
  6987	"Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the Nautilus, if
  6988	the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having made
  6989	the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!"
  6990	
  6991	"Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the
  6992	Cape of Good Hope, sir?"
  6993	
  6994	"Well, unless the Nautilus sails on dry land, and passes above the
  6995	isthmus----"
  6996	
  6997	"Or beneath it, M. Aronnax."
  6998	
  6999	"Beneath it?"
  7000	
  7001	"Certainly," replied Captain Nemo quietly.  "A long time ago Nature
  7002	made under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its
  7003	surface."
  7004	
  7005	"What! such a passage exists?"
  7006	
  7007	"Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel.
  7008	It takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium."
  7009	
  7010	"But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?"
  7011	
  7012	"To a certain depth.  But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid
  7013	layer of rock."
  7014	
  7015	"Did you discover this passage by chance?"  I asked more and more
  7016	surprised.
  7017	
  7018	"Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.
  7019	Not only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several
  7020	times.  Without that I should not have ventured this day into the
  7021	impassable Red Sea.  I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the
  7022	Mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind
  7023	perfectly identical.  Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it
  7024	possible that there was no communication between the two seas?  If
  7025	there was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red
  7026	Sea to the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level.
  7027	I caught a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez.  I
  7028	passed a copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the
  7029	sea.  Some months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my
  7030	fish ornamented with the ring.  Thus the communication between the two
  7031	was proved.  I then sought for it with my Nautilus; I discovered it,
  7032	ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed
  7033	through my Arabian tunnel!"
  7034	
  7035	
  7036	
  7037	CHAPTER V
  7038	
  7039	THE ARABIAN TUNNEL
  7040	
  7041	That same evening, in 21° 30' N. lat., the Nautilus floated on the
  7042	surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast.  I saw Djeddah, the
  7043	most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India.  I
  7044	distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the
  7045	quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the
  7046	roads.  The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses
  7047	of the town, bringing out their whiteness.  Outside, some wooden
  7048	cabins, and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the
  7049	Bedouins.  Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night,
  7050	and the Nautilus found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.
  7051	
  7052	The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to
  7053	windward.  The Nautilus returned to its submarine navigation; but at
  7054	noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose
  7055	again to her waterline.
  7056	
  7057	Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform.  The
  7058	coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a
  7059	damp fog.
  7060	
  7061	We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and
  7062	another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the
  7063	sea, said:
  7064	
  7065	"Do you see anything there, sir?"
  7066	
  7067	"No, Ned," I replied; "but I have not your eyes, you know."
  7068	
  7069	"Look well," said Ned, "there, on the starboard beam, about the height
  7070	of the lantern!  Do you not see a mass which seems to move?"
  7071	
  7072	"Certainly," said I, after close attention; "I see something like a
  7073	long black body on the top of the water."
  7074	
  7075	And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile
  7076	from us.  It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea.
  7077	It was a gigantic dugong!
  7078	
  7079	Ned Land looked eagerly.  His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight
  7080	of the animal.  His hand seemed ready to harpoon it.  One would have
  7081	thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and
  7082	attack it in its element.
  7083	
  7084	At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He saw the
  7085	dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude, and, addressing him, said:
  7086	
  7087	"If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your
  7088	hand?"
  7089	
  7090	"Just so, sir."
  7091	
  7092	"And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a
  7093	fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have
  7094	already killed?"
  7095	
  7096	"I should not, sir."
  7097	
  7098	"Well, you can try."
  7099	
  7100	"Thank you, sir," said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.
  7101	
  7102	"Only," continued the Captain, "I advise you for your own sake not to
  7103	miss the creature."
  7104	
  7105	"Is the dugong dangerous to attack?"  I asked, in spite of the
  7106	Canadian's shrug of the shoulders.
  7107	
  7108	"Yes," replied the Captain; "sometimes the animal turns upon its
  7109	assailants and overturns their boat.  But for Master Land this danger
  7110	is not to be feared.  His eye is prompt, his arm sure."
  7111	
  7112	At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,
  7113	mounted the platform.  One carried a harpoon and a line similar to
  7114	those employed in catching whales.  The pinnace was lifted from the
  7115	bridge, pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea.  Six oarsmen
  7116	took their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller.  Ned, Conseil,
  7117	and I went to the back of the boat.
  7118	
  7119	"You are not coming, Captain?"  I asked.
  7120	
  7121	"No, sir; but I wish you good sport."
  7122	
  7123	The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards
  7124	the dugong, which floated about two miles from the Nautilus.
  7125	
  7126	Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and
  7127	the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters.  Ned Land, harpoon
  7128	in hand, stood in the fore part of the boat.  The harpoon used for
  7129	striking the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs
  7130	out rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him.  But here the
  7131	cord was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached
  7132	to a small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong
  7133	took under the water.
  7134	
  7135	I stood and carefully watched the Canadian's adversary.  This dugong,
  7136	which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the
  7137	manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its
  7138	lateral fins in perfect fingers.  Its difference from the manatee
  7139	consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed
  7140	teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.
  7141	
  7142	This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal
  7143	dimensions; it was more than seven yards long.  It did not move, and
  7144	seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier
  7145	to capture.
  7146	
  7147	The boat approached within six yards of the animal.  The oars rested on
  7148	the rowlocks.  I half rose.  Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,
  7149	brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.
  7150	
  7151	Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared.  The
  7152	harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck
  7153	the water.
  7154	
  7155	"Curse it!" exclaimed the Canadian furiously; "I have missed it!"
  7156	
  7157	"No," said I; "the creature is wounded--look at the blood; but your
  7158	weapon has not stuck in his body."
  7159	
  7160	"My harpoon! my harpoon!" cried Ned Land.
  7161	
  7162	The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.
  7163	The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.
  7164	
  7165	The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe.  Its wound had
  7166	not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.
  7167	
  7168	The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track.  Several times it
  7169	approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,
  7170	but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to
  7171	reach it.
  7172	
  7173	Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land!  He hurled at the
  7174	unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English
  7175	tongue.  For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our
  7176	attacks.
  7177	
  7178	We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it
  7179	would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the
  7180	perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon
  7181	the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.
  7182	
  7183	This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.
  7184	
  7185	"Look out!" he cried.
  7186	
  7187	The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless
  7188	warning the men to keep on their guard.
  7189	
  7190	The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the
  7191	air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but
  7192	in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw
  7193	himself upon us.
  7194	
  7195	The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least
  7196	two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the
  7197	coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite
  7198	overturned.  While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the
  7199	gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature's teeth were
  7200	buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,
  7201	as a lion does a roebuck.  We were upset over one another, and I know
  7202	not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged
  7203	with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.
  7204	
  7205	I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,
  7206	carrying the harpoon with him.  But the barrel soon returned to the
  7207	surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.
  7208	The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the
  7209	Nautilus.
  7210	
  7211	It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the
  7212	platform.  It weighed 10,000 lb.
  7213	
  7214	The next day, 11th February, the larder of the Nautilus was enriched by
  7215	some more delicate game.  A flight of sea-swallows rested on the
  7216	Nautilus.  It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;
  7217	its beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white
  7218	spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and
  7219	throat white, and claws red.  They also took some dozen of Nile ducks,
  7220	a wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head
  7221	white with black spots.
  7222	
  7223	About five o'clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of
  7224	Ras-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,
  7225	comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.
  7226	
  7227	The Nautilus penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the
  7228	Gulf of Suez.  I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the
  7229	two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of
  7230	which Moses saw God face to face.
  7231	
  7232	At six o'clock the Nautilus, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,
  7233	passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the
  7234	waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by
  7235	Captain Nemo.  Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,
  7236	sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and
  7237	the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the
  7238	rocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the
  7239	Gulf with its noisy paddles.
  7240	
  7241	From eight to nine o'clock the Nautilus remained some fathoms under the
  7242	water.  According to my calculation we must have been very near Suez.
  7243	Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks
  7244	brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp.  We seemed to be leaving the
  7245	Straits behind us more and more.
  7246	
  7247	At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I
  7248	mounted the platform.  Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo's
  7249	tunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh
  7250	night air.
  7251	
  7252	Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,
  7253	shining about a mile from us.
  7254	
  7255	"A floating lighthouse!" said someone near me.
  7256	
  7257	I turned, and saw the Captain.
  7258	
  7259	"It is the floating light of Suez," he continued.  "It will not be long
  7260	before we gain the entrance of the tunnel."
  7261	
  7262	"The entrance cannot be easy?"
  7263	
  7264	"No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman's
  7265	cage and myself direct our course.  And now, if you will go down, M.
  7266	Aronnax, the Nautilus is going under the waves, and will not return to
  7267	the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel."
  7268	
  7269	Captain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he
  7270	opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot's
  7271	cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.
  7272	It was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied
  7273	by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson.  In the
  7274	midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,
  7275	which ran to the back of the Nautilus.  Four light-ports with
  7276	lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,
  7277	allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.
  7278	
  7279	This cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the
  7280	obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands
  7281	resting on the spokes of the wheel.  Outside, the sea appeared vividly
  7282	lit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin
  7283	to the other extremity of the platform.
  7284	
  7285	"Now," said Captain Nemo, "let us try to make our passage."
  7286	
  7287	Electric wires connected the pilot's cage with the machinery room, and
  7288	from there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his Nautilus
  7289	the direction and the speed.  He pressed a metal knob, and at once the
  7290	speed of the screw diminished.
  7291	
  7292	I looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at
  7293	this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast.  We followed
  7294	it thus for an hour only some few yards off.
  7295	
  7296	Captain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two
  7297	concentric circles in the cabin.  At a simple gesture, the pilot
  7298	modified the course of the Nautilus every instant.
  7299	
  7300	I had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent
  7301	substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their
  7302	enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.
  7303	
  7304	At a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm.  A large
  7305	gallery, black and deep, opened before us.  The Nautilus went boldly
  7306	into it.  A strange roaring was heard round its sides.  It was the
  7307	waters of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated
  7308	violently towards the Mediterranean.  The Nautilus went with the
  7309	torrent, rapid as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery,
  7310	which, in order to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with
  7311	reversed screw.
  7312	
  7313	On the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant
  7314	rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under
  7315	the brilliant electric light.  My heart beat fast.
  7316	
  7317	At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,
  7318	turning to me, said:
  7319	
  7320	"The Mediterranean!"
  7321	
  7322	In less than twenty minutes, the Nautilus, carried along by the
  7323	torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez.
  7324	
  7325	
  7326	
  7327	CHAPTER VI
  7328	
  7329	THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO
  7330	
  7331	The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the Nautilus
  7332	rose to the surface.  I hastened on to the platform.  Three miles to
  7333	the south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen.  A torrent had
  7334	carried us from one sea to another.  About seven o'clock Ned and
  7335	Conseil joined me.
  7336	
  7337	"Well, Sir Naturalist," said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,
  7338	"and the Mediterranean?"
  7339	
  7340	"We are floating on its surface, friend Ned."
  7341	
  7342	"What!" said Conseil, "this very night."
  7343	
  7344	"Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable
  7345	isthmus."
  7346	
  7347	"I do not believe it," replied the Canadian.
  7348	
  7349	"Then you are wrong, Master Land," I continued; "this low coast which
  7350	rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast.  And you who have such
  7351	good eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the
  7352	sea."
  7353	
  7354	The Canadian looked attentively.
  7355	
  7356	"Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man.
  7357	We are in the Mediterranean.  Good!  Now, if you please, let us talk of
  7358	our own little affair, but so that no one hears us."
  7359	
  7360	I saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better
  7361	to let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down
  7362	near the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the blades.
  7363	
  7364	"Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?"
  7365	
  7366	"What I have to tell you is very simple.  We are in Europe; and before
  7367	Captain Nemo's caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar
  7368	Seas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the Nautilus."
  7369	
  7370	I wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I
  7371	certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.
  7372	
  7373	Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the
  7374	completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of
  7375	submarine depths in its very element.  Should I ever again have such an
  7376	opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean?  No, certainly not!
  7377	And I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the Nautilus
  7378	before the cycle of investigation was accomplished.
  7379	
  7380	"Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board?  Are
  7381	you sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo's hands?"
  7382	
  7383	The Canadian remained some moments without answering.  Then, crossing
  7384	his arms, he said:
  7385	
  7386	"Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas.  I shall be glad
  7387	to have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.
  7388	That is my idea."
  7389	
  7390	"It will come to an end, Ned."
  7391	
  7392	"Where and when?"
  7393	
  7394	"Where I do not know--when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will
  7395	end when these seas have nothing more to teach us."
  7396	
  7397	"Then what do you hope for?" demanded the Canadian.
  7398	
  7399	"That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which
  7400	we may and ought to profit."
  7401	
  7402	"Oh!" said Ned Land, "and where shall we be in six months, if you
  7403	please, Sir Naturalist?"
  7404	
  7405	"Perhaps in China; you know the Nautilus is a rapid traveller.  It goes
  7406	through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the
  7407	land.  It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not
  7408	beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be
  7409	attempted as advantageously as here."
  7410	
  7411	"M. Aronnax," replied the Canadian, "your arguments are rotten at the
  7412	foundation.  You speak in the future, `We shall be there!  we shall be
  7413	here!'  I speak in the present, `We are here, and we must profit by
  7414	it.'"
  7415	
  7416	Ned Land's logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that
  7417	ground.  I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.
  7418	
  7419	"Sir," continued Ned, "let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo
  7420	should this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?"
  7421	
  7422	"I do not know," I answered.
  7423	
  7424	"And if," he added, "the offer made you this day was never to be
  7425	renewed, would you accept it?"
  7426	
  7427	"Friend Ned, this is my answer.  Your reasoning is against me.  We must
  7428	not rely on Captain Nemo's good-will. Common prudence forbids him to
  7429	set us at liberty.  On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the
  7430	first opportunity to leave the Nautilus."
  7431	
  7432	"Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said."
  7433	
  7434	"Only one observation--just one.  The occasion must be serious, and our
  7435	first attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,
  7436	and Captain Nemo will never forgive us."
  7437	
  7438	"All that is true," replied the Canadian.  "But your observation
  7439	applies equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years' time,
  7440	or in two days'. But the question is still this: If a favourable
  7441	opportunity presents itself, it must be seized."
  7442	
  7443	"Agreed!  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable
  7444	opportunity?"
  7445	
  7446	"It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the Nautilus a
  7447	short distance from some European coast."
  7448	
  7449	"And you will try and save yourself by swimming?"
  7450	
  7451	"Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was
  7452	floating at the time.  Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was
  7453	under the water."
  7454	
  7455	"And in that case?"
  7456	
  7457	"In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace.  I
  7458	know how it is worked.  We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn,
  7459	we shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who
  7460	is in the bows, perceiving our flight."
  7461	
  7462	"Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch
  7463	will ruin us."
  7464	
  7465	"I will not forget, sir."
  7466	
  7467	"And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?"
  7468	
  7469	"Certainly, M. Aronnax."
  7470	
  7471	"Well, I think--I do not say I hope--I think that this favourable
  7472	opportunity will never present itself."
  7473	
  7474	"Why not?"
  7475	
  7476	"Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given
  7477	up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,
  7478	above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts."
  7479	
  7480	"We shall see," replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.
  7481	
  7482	"And now, Ned Land," I added, "let us stop here.  Not another word on
  7483	the subject.  The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we
  7484	will follow you.  I rely entirely upon you."
  7485	
  7486	Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such
  7487	grave results.  I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my
  7488	foresight, to the Canadian's great despair.  Did Captain Nemo distrust
  7489	us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from
  7490	the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?
  7491	I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the
  7492	coast.  Or, if the Nautilus did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the
  7493	pilot's cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the
  7494	Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by
  7495	more than a thousand fathoms.
  7496	
  7497	Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the
  7498	Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:
  7499	
  7500	    "Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,
  7501	     Caeruleus Proteus,"
  7502	
  7503	as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.
  7504	
  7505	It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of
  7506	Neptune's flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes
  7507	and Crete.  I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels
  7508	of the saloon.
  7509	
  7510	The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in
  7511	studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other
  7512	the panels remained hermetically sealed.  Upon taking the course of the
  7513	Nautilus, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle
  7514	of Crete.  At the time I embarked on the Abraham Lincoln, the whole of
  7515	this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the
  7516	Turks.  But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was
  7517	absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land
  7518	communications, who could tell me.
  7519	
  7520	I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone
  7521	with him in the saloon.  Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and
  7522	preoccupied.  Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to
  7523	be opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of
  7524	waters attentively.  To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I
  7525	employed my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.
  7526	
  7527	In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his
  7528	belt a leathern purse.  It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it
  7529	was a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing
  7530	occasionally to take breath at the surface.
  7531	
  7532	I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:
  7533	
  7534	"A man shipwrecked!  He must be saved at any price!"
  7535	
  7536	The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.
  7537	
  7538	The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,
  7539	was looking at us.
  7540	
  7541	To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him.  The diver answered
  7542	with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did
  7543	not appear again.
  7544	
  7545	"Do not be uncomfortable," said Captain Nemo.  "It is Nicholas of Cape
  7546	Matapan, surnamed Pesca.  He is well known in all the Cyclades.  A bold
  7547	diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,
  7548	going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete."
  7549	
  7550	"You know him, Captain?"
  7551	
  7552	"Why not, M. Aronnax?"
  7553	
  7554	Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing
  7555	near the left panel of the saloon.  Near this piece of furniture, I saw
  7556	a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,
  7557	bearing the cypher of the Nautilus with its device.
  7558	
  7559	At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the
  7560	piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many
  7561	ingots.
  7562	
  7563	They were ingots of gold.  From whence came this precious metal, which
  7564	represented an enormous sum?  Where did the Captain gather this gold
  7565	from? and what was he going to do with it?
  7566	
  7567	I did not say one word.  I looked.  Captain Nemo took the ingots one by
  7568	one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled
  7569	entirely.  I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lb. weight of
  7570	gold, that is to say, nearly L200,000.
  7571	
  7572	The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on
  7573	the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.
  7574	
  7575	This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated
  7576	with the quarters of the crew.  Four men appeared, and, not without
  7577	some trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon.  Then I heard them
  7578	hoisting it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.
  7579	
  7580	At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.
  7581	
  7582	"And you were saying, sir?" said he.
  7583	
  7584	"I was saying nothing, Captain."
  7585	
  7586	"Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night."
  7587	
  7588	Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.
  7589	
  7590	I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe.  I vainly
  7591	tried to sleep--I sought the connecting link between the apparition of
  7592	the diver and the chest filled with gold.  Soon, I felt by certain
  7593	movements of pitching and tossing that the Nautilus was leaving the
  7594	depths and returning to the surface.
  7595	
  7596	Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening
  7597	the pinnace and launching it upon the waves.  For one instant it struck
  7598	the side of the Nautilus, then all noise ceased.
  7599	
  7600	Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;
  7601	the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus
  7602	again plunged under the waves.
  7603	
  7604	So these millions had been transported to their address.  To what point
  7605	of the continent?  Who was Captain Nemo's correspondent?
  7606	
  7607	The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the
  7608	night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree.  My
  7609	companions were not less surprised than myself.
  7610	
  7611	"But where does he take his millions to?" asked Ned Land.
  7612	
  7613	To that there was no possible answer.  I returned to the saloon after
  7614	having breakfast and set to work.  Till five o'clock in the evening I
  7615	employed myself in arranging my notes.  At that moment--(ought I to
  7616	attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)--I felt so great a heat
  7617	that I was obliged to take off my coat.  It was strange, for we were
  7618	under low latitudes; and even then the Nautilus, submerged as it was,
  7619	ought to experience no change of temperature.  I looked at the
  7620	manometer; it showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat
  7621	could never attain.
  7622	
  7623	I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be
  7624	intolerable.
  7625	
  7626	"Could there be fire on board?"  I asked myself.
  7627	
  7628	I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the
  7629	thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:
  7630	
  7631	"Forty-two degrees."
  7632	
  7633	"I have noticed it, Captain," I replied; "and if it gets much hotter we
  7634	cannot bear it."
  7635	
  7636	"Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it."
  7637	
  7638	"You can reduce it as you please, then?"
  7639	
  7640	"No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it."
  7641	
  7642	"It is outward, then!"
  7643	
  7644	"Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water."
  7645	
  7646	"Is it possible!"  I exclaimed.
  7647	
  7648	"Look."
  7649	
  7650	The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round.  A
  7651	sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in
  7652	a copper.  I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat
  7653	was so great that I quickly took it off again.
  7654	
  7655	"Where are we?"  I asked.
  7656	
  7657	"Near the Island of Santorin, sir," replied the Captain.  "I wished to
  7658	give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption."
  7659	
  7660	"I thought," said I, "that the formation of these new islands was
  7661	ended."
  7662	
  7663	"Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea," replied
  7664	Captain Nemo; "and the globe is always being worked by subterranean
  7665	fires.  Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to
  7666	Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in
  7667	the very place where these islets have recently been formed.  Then they
  7668	sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again
  7669	subsided.  Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been
  7670	suspended.  But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they
  7671	named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour
  7672	near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month.  Seven
  7673	days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,
  7674	leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad.  I was
  7675	in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to
  7676	observe all the different phases.  The Island of Aphroessa, of round
  7677	form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height.  It was
  7678	composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.
  7679	And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed
  7680	itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined
  7681	together, forming but one and the same island."
  7682	
  7683	"And the canal in which we are at this moment?"  I asked.
  7684	
  7685	"Here it is," replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the
  7686	Archipelago.  "You see, I have marked the new islands."
  7687	
  7688	I returned to the glass.  The Nautilus was no longer moving, the heat
  7689	was becoming unbearable.  The sea, which till now had been white, was
  7690	red, owing to the presence of salts of iron.  In spite of the ship's
  7691	being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the
  7692	saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished
  7693	by bright scarlet flames.  I was in a bath, I was choking, I was
  7694	broiled.
  7695	
  7696	"We can remain no longer in this boiling water," said I to the Captain.
  7697	
  7698	"It would not be prudent," replied the impassive Captain Nemo.
  7699	
  7700	An order was given; the Nautilus tacked about and left the furnace it
  7701	could not brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour after we were
  7702	breathing fresh air on the surface.  The thought then struck me that,
  7703	if Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should
  7704	never have come alive out of this sea of fire.
  7705	
  7706	The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between
  7707	Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and
  7708	the Nautilus, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian
  7709	Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.
  7710	
  7711	
  7712	
  7713	CHAPTER VII
  7714	
  7715	THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS
  7716	
  7717	The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, "the great sea" of the
  7718	Hebrews, "the sea" of the Greeks, the "mare nostrum" of the Romans,
  7719	bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with
  7720	the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with
  7721	pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;
  7722	a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the
  7723	empire of the world!
  7724	
  7725	It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is
  7726	renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe.  But,
  7727	beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin
  7728	whose superficial area is two million of square yards.  Even Captain
  7729	Nemo's knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not
  7730	appear once during our passage at full speed.  I estimated the course
  7731	which the Nautilus took under the waves of the sea at about six hundred
  7732	leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours.  Starting on the
  7733	morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we had
  7734	crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.
  7735	
  7736	It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of
  7737	those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain
  7738	Nemo.  Those waves and those breezes brought back too many
  7739	remembrances, if not too many regrets.  Here he had no longer that
  7740	independence and that liberty of gait which he had when in the open
  7741	seas, and his Nautilus felt itself cramped between the close shores of
  7742	Africa and Europe.
  7743	
  7744	Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour.  It may be well understood
  7745	that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his
  7746	intended flight.  He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of
  7747	twelve or thirteen yards every second.  To quit the Nautilus under such
  7748	conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full
  7749	speed--an imprudent thing, to say the least of it.  Besides, our vessel
  7750	only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of
  7751	air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.
  7752	
  7753	I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by
  7754	express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;
  7755	that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which
  7756	pass like a flash of lightning.
  7757	
  7758	We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis.  In the
  7759	narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of
  7760	the sea rose almost suddenly.  There was a perfect bank, on which there
  7761	was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the
  7762	depth was ninety fathoms.
  7763	
  7764	The Nautilus had to manoeuvre very carefully so as not to strike
  7765	against this submarine barrier.
  7766	
  7767	I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by
  7768	this reef.
  7769	
  7770	"But if you please, sir," observed Conseil, "it is like a real isthmus
  7771	joining Europe to Africa."
  7772	
  7773	"Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the
  7774	soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents
  7775	between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined."
  7776	
  7777	"I can well believe it," said Conseil.
  7778	
  7779	"I will add," I continued, "that a similar barrier exists between
  7780	Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire
  7781	Mediterranean."
  7782	
  7783	"What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers
  7784	above the waves?"
  7785	
  7786	"It is not probable, Conseil."
  7787	
  7788	"Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should
  7789	take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so
  7790	much pains to pierce the isthmus."
  7791	
  7792	"I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never
  7793	happen.  The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.
  7794	Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being
  7795	extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature
  7796	of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity
  7797	every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life."
  7798	
  7799	"But the sun?"
  7800	
  7801	"The sun is not sufficient, Conseil.  Can it give heat to a dead body?"
  7802	
  7803	"Not that I know of."
  7804	
  7805	"Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will
  7806	become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long
  7807	since lost all its vital heat."
  7808	
  7809	"In how many centuries?"
  7810	
  7811	"In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy."
  7812	
  7813	"Then," said Conseil, "we shall have time to finish our journey--that
  7814	is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it."
  7815	
  7816	And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the
  7817	Nautilus was skirting at a moderate speed.
  7818	
  7819	During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the
  7820	second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450
  7821	fathoms.  The Nautilus, by the action of its crew, slid down the
  7822	inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.
  7823	
  7824	On the 18th of February, about three o'clock in the morning, we were at
  7825	the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar.  There once existed two
  7826	currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters
  7827	of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower
  7828	counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist.  Indeed, the
  7829	volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves
  7830	of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise
  7831	the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore
  7832	the equilibrium.  As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the
  7833	existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the
  7834	Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the
  7835	Mediterranean.  A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which
  7836	the Nautilus profited.  It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass.  For
  7837	one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of
  7838	Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low
  7839	island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on
  7840	the Atlantic.
  7841	
  7842	
  7843	
  7844	CHAPTER VIII
  7845	
  7846	VIGO BAY
  7847	
  7848	The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers
  7849	twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine
  7850	thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred--an
  7851	ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,
  7852	watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the
  7853	Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the
  7854	Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the
  7855	most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries!
  7856	Magnificent field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every
  7857	nation, sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in
  7858	those two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the
  7859	Cape of Tempests.
  7860	
  7861	The Nautilus was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having
  7862	accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a
  7863	distance greater than the great circle of the earth.  Where were we
  7864	going now, and what was reserved for the future?  The Nautilus, leaving
  7865	the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out.  It returned to the surface
  7866	of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored to us.
  7867	
  7868	I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil.  At a distance
  7869	of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming
  7870	the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula.  A strong southerly
  7871	gale was blowing.  The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the
  7872	Nautilus rock violently.  It was almost impossible to keep one's foot
  7873	on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every
  7874	instant.  So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.
  7875	
  7876	I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a
  7877	preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the
  7878	Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,
  7879	and he could not help showing his disappointment.  When the door of my
  7880	room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.
  7881	
  7882	"Friend Ned," said I, "I understand you; but you cannot reproach
  7883	yourself.  To have attempted to leave the Nautilus under the
  7884	circumstances would have been folly."
  7885	
  7886	Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed
  7887	with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.
  7888	
  7889	"Let us see," I continued; "we need not despair yet.  We are going up
  7890	the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where
  7891	we can easily find refuge.  Now if the Nautilus, on leaving the Straits
  7892	of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us towards
  7893	regions where there were no continents, I should share your uneasiness.
  7894	But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from civilised seas, and
  7895	in some days I think you can act with security."
  7896	
  7897	Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,
  7898	and he said, "It is for to-night."
  7899	
  7900	I drew myself up suddenly.  I was, I admit, little prepared for this
  7901	communication.  I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not
  7902	come.
  7903	
  7904	"We agreed to wait for an opportunity," continued Ned Land, "and the
  7905	opportunity has arrived.  This night we shall be but a few miles from
  7906	the Spanish coast.  It is cloudy.  The wind blows freely.  I have your
  7907	word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you."
  7908	
  7909	As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.
  7910	
  7911	"To-night, at nine o'clock," said he.  "I have warned Conseil.  At that
  7912	moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.
  7913	Neither the engineers nor the ship's crew can see us.  Conseil and I
  7914	will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in
  7915	the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal.  The oars, the mast,
  7916	and the sail are in the canoe.  I have even succeeded in getting some
  7917	provisions.  I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts
  7918	which attach it to the shell of the Nautilus.  So all is ready, till
  7919	to-night."
  7920	
  7921	"The sea is bad."
  7922	
  7923	"That I allow," replied the Canadian; "but we must risk that.  Liberty
  7924	is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with
  7925	a fair wind to carry us is no great thing.  Who knows but by to-morrow
  7926	we may be a hundred leagues away?  Let circumstances only favour us,
  7927	and by ten or eleven o'clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra
  7928	firma, alive or dead.  But adieu now till to-night."
  7929	
  7930	With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb.  I had
  7931	imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and
  7932	discuss the matter.  My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,
  7933	after all, what could I have said to him?  Ned Land was perfectly
  7934	right.  There was almost the opportunity to profit by.  Could I retract
  7935	my word, and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the
  7936	future of my companions?  To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from
  7937	all land.
  7938	
  7939	At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs
  7940	were filling, and that the Nautilus was sinking under the waves of the
  7941	Atlantic.
  7942	
  7943	A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of
  7944	action and of abandoning the wonderful Nautilus, and leaving my
  7945	submarine studies incomplete.
  7946	
  7947	What dreadful hours I passed thus!  Sometimes seeing myself and
  7948	companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,
  7949	that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned
  7950	Land's project.
  7951	
  7952	Twice I went to the saloon.  I wished to consult the compass.  I wished
  7953	to see if the direction the Nautilus was taking was bringing us nearer
  7954	or taking us farther from the coast.  But no; the Nautilus kept in
  7955	Portuguese waters.
  7956	
  7957	I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight.  My luggage was
  7958	not heavy; my notes, nothing more.
  7959	
  7960	As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;
  7961	what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in
  7962	case of its discovery or failure.  Certainly I had no cause to complain
  7963	of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his.  In
  7964	leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude.  No oath bound us to
  7965	him.  It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon
  7966	our word, to fix us for ever.
  7967	
  7968	I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.
  7969	Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure?  I wished
  7970	it, and I feared it at the same time.  I listened if I could hear him
  7971	walking the room contiguous to mine.  No sound reached my ear.  I felt
  7972	an unbearable uneasiness.  This day of waiting seemed eternal.  Hours
  7973	struck too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.
  7974	
  7975	My dinner was served in my room as usual.  I ate but little; I was too
  7976	preoccupied.  I left the table at seven o'clock. A hundred and twenty
  7977	minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I
  7978	was to join Ned Land.  My agitation redoubled.  My pulse beat
  7979	violently.  I could not remain quiet.  I went and came, hoping to calm
  7980	my troubled spirit by constant movement.  The idea of failure in our
  7981	bold enterprise was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought
  7982	of seeing our project discovered before leaving the Nautilus, of being
  7983	brought before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened,
  7984	at my desertion, made my heart beat.
  7985	
  7986	I wanted to see the saloon for the last time.  I descended the stairs
  7987	and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and
  7988	agreeable hours.  I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a
  7989	man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.
  7990	
  7991	These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for
  7992	so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them
  7993	for ever!  I should like to have taken a last look through the windows
  7994	of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic:  but the panels were
  7995	hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean
  7996	which I had not yet explored.
  7997	
  7998	In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle
  7999	which opened into the Captain's room.  To my great surprise, this door
  8000	was ajar.  I drew back involuntarily.  If Captain Nemo should be in his
  8001	room, he could see me.  But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer.  The room
  8002	was deserted.  I pushed open the door and took some steps forward.
  8003	Still the same monklike severity of aspect.
  8004	
  8005	Suddenly the clock struck eight.  The first beat of the hammer on the
  8006	bell awoke me from my dreams.  I trembled as if an invisible eye had
  8007	plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.
  8008	
  8009	There my eye fell upon the compass.  Our course was still north.  The
  8010	log indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.
  8011	
  8012	I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly--sea boots, an otterskin
  8013	cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was
  8014	waiting.  The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which
  8015	reigned on board.  I listened attentively.  Would no loud voice
  8016	suddenly inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected
  8017	flight.  A mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my
  8018	accustomed coolness.
  8019	
  8020	At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain's door.  No
  8021	noise.  I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in
  8022	obscurity, but deserted.
  8023	
  8024	I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same
  8025	insufficient light, the same solitude.  I placed myself near the door
  8026	leading to the central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land's
  8027	signal.
  8028	
  8029	At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it
  8030	stopped entirely.  The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings
  8031	of my own heart.  Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the
  8032	Nautilus had stopped at the bottom of the ocean.  My uneasiness
  8033	increased.  The Canadian's signal did not come.  I felt inclined to
  8034	join Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt.  I felt that we
  8035	were not sailing under our usual conditions.
  8036	
  8037	At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo
  8038	appeared.  He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable
  8039	tone of voice:
  8040	
  8041	"Ah, sir!  I have been looking for you.  Do you know the history of
  8042	Spain?"
  8043	
  8044	Now, one might know the history of one's own country by heart; but in
  8045	the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite
  8046	lost, I could not have said a word of it.
  8047	
  8048	"Well," continued Captain Nemo, "you heard my question!  Do you know
  8049	the history of Spain?"
  8050	
  8051	"Very slightly," I answered.
  8052	
  8053	"Well, here are learned men having to learn," said the Captain.  "Come,
  8054	sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history.  Sir,
  8055	listen well," said he; "this history will interest you on one side, for
  8056	it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to
  8057	solve."
  8058	
  8059	"I listen, Captain," said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was
  8060	driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our
  8061	projected flight.
  8062	
  8063	"Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702.  You cannot be
  8064	ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a
  8065	potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had
  8066	imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards.  This prince
  8067	reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong
  8068	party against him abroad.  Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses
  8069	of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at
  8070	the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the
  8071	head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they
  8072	prematurely gave the title of Charles III.
  8073	
  8074	"Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely
  8075	unprovided with either soldiers or sailors.  However, money would not
  8076	fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver
  8077	from America, once entered their ports.  And about the end of 1702 they
  8078	expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of
  8079	twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the
  8080	ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic.  This convoy
  8081	was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was
  8082	cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.
  8083	
  8084	"The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision.  They
  8085	wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo
  8086	Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not
  8087	blocked.
  8088	
  8089	"Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and
  8090	the galleons entered Vigo Bay.
  8091	
  8092	"Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in
  8093	any way.  They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the
  8094	arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had
  8095	not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.
  8096	
  8097	"You are following the chain of events?" asked Captain Nemo.
  8098	
  8099	"Perfectly," said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical
  8100	lesson.
  8101	
  8102	"I will continue.  This is what passed.  The merchants of Cadiz had a
  8103	privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise
  8104	coming from the West Indies.  Now, to disembark these ingots at the
  8105	port of Vigo was depriving them of their rights.  They complained at
  8106	Madrid, and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the
  8107	convoy, without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the
  8108	roads of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.
  8109	
  8110	"But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the
  8111	English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in
  8112	spite of inferior forces, fought bravely.  But, seeing that the
  8113	treasure must fall into the enemy's hands, he burnt and scuttled every
  8114	galleon, which went to the bottom with their immense riches."
  8115	
  8116	Captain Nemo stopped.  I admit I could not see yet why this history
  8117	should interest me.
  8118	
  8119	"Well?"  I asked.
  8120	
  8121	"Well, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, "we are in that Vigo Bay; and
  8122	it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries."
  8123	
  8124	The Captain rose, telling me to follow him.  I had had time to recover.
  8125	I obeyed.  The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the
  8126	waves were sparkling.  I looked.
  8127	
  8128	For half a mile around the Nautilus, the waters seemed bathed in
  8129	electric light.  The sandy bottom was clean and bright.  Some of the
  8130	ship's crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten
  8131	barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks.  From
  8132	these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,
  8133	cascades of piastres and jewels.  The sand was heaped up with them.
  8134	Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the Nautilus,
  8135	disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery
  8136	of gold and silver.
  8137	
  8138	I understood now.  This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of
  8139	October, 1702.  Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the
  8140	Spanish Government had sunk.  Here Captain Nemo came, according to his
  8141	wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the Nautilus.
  8142	It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.
  8143	He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn
  8144	from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.
  8145	
  8146	"Did you know, sir," he asked, smiling, "that the sea contained such
  8147	riches?"
  8148	
  8149	"I knew," I answered, "that they value money held in suspension in
  8150	these waters at two millions."
  8151	
  8152	"Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than
  8153	the profit.  Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has
  8154	lost--and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where
  8155	shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map.
  8156	Can you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?"
  8157	
  8158	"I understand, Captain.  But allow me to tell you that in exploring
  8159	Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society."
  8160	
  8161	"And which?"
  8162	
  8163	"A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege
  8164	of seeking those buried galleons.  The shareholders are led on by the
  8165	allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks
  8166	at five hundred millions."
  8167	
  8168	"Five hundred millions they were," answered Captain Nemo, "but they are
  8169	so no longer."
  8170	
  8171	"Just so," said I; "and a warning to those shareholders would be an act
  8172	of charity.  But who knows if it would be well received?  What gamblers
  8173	usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their
  8174	foolish hopes.  After all, I pity them less than the thousands of
  8175	unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been
  8176	profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren."
  8177	
  8178	I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have
  8179	wounded Captain Nemo.
  8180	
  8181	"Barren!" he exclaimed, with animation.  "Do you think then, sir, that
  8182	these riches are lost because I gather them?  Is it for myself alone,
  8183	according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these
  8184	treasures?  Who told you that I did not make a good use of it?  Do you
  8185	think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races
  8186	on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge?  Do
  8187	you not understand?"
  8188	
  8189	Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he
  8190	had spoken so much.  But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which
  8191	had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him
  8192	still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,
  8193	and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as
  8194	individuals.  And I then understood for whom those millions were
  8195	destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the Nautilus was
  8196	cruising in the waters of Crete.
  8197	
  8198	
  8199	
  8200	CHAPTER IX
  8201	
  8202	A VANISHED CONTINENT
  8203	
  8204	The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my
  8205	room.  I expected this visit.  He looked very disappointed.
  8206	
  8207	"Well, sir?" said he.
  8208	
  8209	"Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday."
  8210	
  8211	"Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended
  8212	leaving his vessel."
  8213	
  8214	"Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers."
  8215	
  8216	"His bankers!"
  8217	
  8218	"Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his
  8219	riches are safer than in the chests of the State."
  8220	
  8221	I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,
  8222	hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but
  8223	my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret
  8224	from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of
  8225	Vigo on his own account.
  8226	
  8227	"However," said he, "all is not ended.  It is only a blow of the
  8228	harpoon lost.  Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if
  8229	necessary----"
  8230	
  8231	"In what direction is the Nautilus going?"  I asked.
  8232	
  8233	"I do not know," replied Ned.
  8234	
  8235	"Well, at noon we shall see the point."
  8236	
  8237	The Canadian returned to Conseil.  As soon as I was dressed, I went
  8238	into the saloon.  The compass was not reassuring.  The course of the
  8239	Nautilus was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.
  8240	
  8241	I waited with some impatience till the ship's place was pricked on the
  8242	chart.  At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our
  8243	vessel rose to the surface of the ocean.  I rushed towards the
  8244	platform.  Ned Land had preceded me.  No more land in sight.  Nothing
  8245	but an immense sea.  Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going
  8246	to San Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of
  8247	Good Hope.  The weather was cloudy.  A gale of wind was preparing.  Ned
  8248	raved, and tried to pierce the cloudy horizon.  He still hoped that
  8249	behind all that fog stretched the land he so longed for.
  8250	
  8251	At noon the sun showed itself for an instant.  The second profited by
  8252	this brightness to take its height.  Then, the sea becoming more
  8253	billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.
  8254	
  8255	An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the
  8256	Nautilus was marked at 16° 17' long., and 33° 22' lat., at 150
  8257	leagues from the nearest coast.  There was no means of flight, and I
  8258	leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of
  8259	our situation.
  8260	
  8261	For myself, I was not particularly sorry.  I felt lightened of the load
  8262	which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of
  8263	calmness to my accustomed work.
  8264	
  8265	That night, about eleven o'clock, I received a most unexpected visit
  8266	from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from
  8267	my watch of the preceding night.  I answered in the negative.
  8268	
  8269	"Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion."
  8270	
  8271	"Propose, Captain?"
  8272	
  8273	"You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under
  8274	the brightness of the sun.  Would it suit you to see them in the
  8275	darkness of the night?"
  8276	
  8277	"Most willingly."
  8278	
  8279	"I warn you, the way will be tiring.  We shall have far to walk, and
  8280	must climb a mountain.  The roads are not well kept."
  8281	
  8282	"What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to
  8283	follow you."
  8284	
  8285	"Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses."
  8286	
  8287	Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any
  8288	of the ship's crew were to follow us on this excursion.  Captain Nemo
  8289	had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.
  8290	
  8291	In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our
  8292	backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps
  8293	were prepared.  I called the Captain's attention to the fact.
  8294	
  8295	"They will be useless," he replied.
  8296	
  8297	I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my
  8298	observation, for the Captain's head had already disappeared in its
  8299	metal case.  I finished harnessing myself.  I felt them put an
  8300	iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going
  8301	through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a
  8302	depth of 150 fathoms.  Midnight was near.  The waters were profoundly
  8303	dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a
  8304	sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the
  8305	Nautilus.  What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it
  8306	lit up the liquid mass, I could not say.  In any case, it did light our
  8307	way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar
  8308	darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness
  8309	of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.
  8310	
  8311	As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head.  The noise
  8312	redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood
  8313	the cause.  It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of
  8314	the waves.  Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I
  8315	should be wet through!  By the water! in the midst of the water!  I
  8316	could not help laughing at the odd idea.  But, indeed, in the thick
  8317	diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems
  8318	to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.
  8319	Nothing more.
  8320	
  8321	After half an hour's walk the soil became stony.  Medusae, microscopic
  8322	crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent
  8323	gleam.  I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of
  8324	zoophytes and masses of sea weed.  My feet often slipped upon this
  8325	sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should
  8326	have fallen more than once.  In turning round, I could still see the
  8327	whitish lantern of the Nautilus beginning to pale in the distance.
  8328	
  8329	But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.
  8330	The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.
  8331	Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the _savants_
  8332	of the earth?  Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had the hand
  8333	of man aught to do with this conflagration?  Had he fanned this flame?
  8334	Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain Nemo
  8335	whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange
  8336	existence?  Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who,
  8337	weary of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence
  8338	in the deep ocean?  All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued
  8339	me.  And in this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of
  8340	wonders continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been
  8341	surprised to meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns
  8342	of which Captain Nemo dreamed.
  8343	
  8344	Our road grew lighter and lighter.  The white glimmer came in rays from
  8345	the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high.  But what I saw was
  8346	simply a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters.  The
  8347	source of this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of
  8348	the mountain.
  8349	
  8350	In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,
  8351	Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation.  He knew this dreary road.
  8352	Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself.
  8353	I followed him with unshaken confidence.  He seemed to me like a genie
  8354	of the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his
  8355	stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.
  8356	
  8357	It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the
  8358	mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the
  8359	difficult paths of a vast copse.
  8360	
  8361	Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees
  8362	petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by
  8363	gigantic pines.  It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the
  8364	roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper
  8365	cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling.  Picture to yourself
  8366	a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a
  8367	forest swallowed up.  The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,
  8368	between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea.  I went along,
  8369	climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea
  8370	bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the
  8371	fishes, which flew from branch to branch.  Pressing onward, I felt no
  8372	fatigue.  I followed my guide, who was never tired.  What a spectacle!
  8373	How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in
  8374	this medium--their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with
  8375	red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters
  8376	doubled?  We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic
  8377	bounds and the low growling of an avalanche.  To right and left ran
  8378	long, dark galleries, where sight was lost.  Here opened vast glades
  8379	which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked
  8380	myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly
  8381	appear to me.
  8382	
  8383	But Captain Nemo was still mounting.  I could not stay behind.  I
  8384	followed boldly.  My stick gave me good help.  A false step would have
  8385	been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the
  8386	gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness.  Now
  8387	I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had
  8388	it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady
  8389	trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without
  8390	looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of
  8391	this region.
  8392	
  8393	There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed
  8394	to defy all laws of equilibrium.  From between their stony knees trees
  8395	sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld
  8396	them.  Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a
  8397	"curtain," inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could
  8398	never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.
  8399	
  8400	Two hours after quitting the Nautilus we had crossed the line of trees,
  8401	and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain, which
  8402	cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.  Some
  8403	petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there.  Fishes got up under
  8404	our feet like birds in the long grass.  The massive rocks were rent
  8405	with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes, at
  8406	the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving.  My
  8407	blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some
  8408	frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.
  8409	Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.
  8410	They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant
  8411	lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws
  8412	with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun
  8413	on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their
  8414	tentacles like a living nest of serpents.
  8415	
  8416	We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited
  8417	me.  Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of
  8418	man and not that of the Creator.  There were vast heaps of stone,
  8419	amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles
  8420	and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over
  8421	which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable
  8422	mantle.  But what was this portion of the globe which had been
  8423	swallowed by cataclysms?  Who had placed those rocks and stones like
  8424	cromlechs of prehistoric times?  Where was I?  Whither had Captain
  8425	Nemo's fancy hurried me?
  8426	
  8427	I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him--I seized
  8428	his arm.  But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of
  8429	the mountain, he seemed to say:
  8430	
  8431	"Come, come along; come higher!"
  8432	
  8433	I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a
  8434	circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.
  8435	
  8436	I looked down the side we had just climbed.  The mountain did not rise
  8437	more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but
  8438	on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of
  8439	this part of the Atlantic.  My eyes ranged far over a large space lit
  8440	by a violent fulguration.  In fact, the mountain was a volcano.
  8441	
  8442	At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and
  8443	scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell
  8444	in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass.  Thus situated,
  8445	this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the
  8446	extreme limits of the horizon.  I said that the submarine crater threw
  8447	up lava, but no flames.  Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed
  8448	upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having
  8449	in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white
  8450	heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to
  8451	vapour by contact.
  8452	
  8453	Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of
  8454	lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on
  8455	another Terra del Greco.
  8456	
  8457	There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town--its roofs
  8458	open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns
  8459	lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive
  8460	character of Tuscan architecture.  Further on, some remains of a
  8461	gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the
  8462	floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an
  8463	ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and
  8464	disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on
  8465	again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets--a
  8466	perfect Pompeii escaped beneath the waters.  Such was the sight that
  8467	Captain Nemo brought before my eyes!
  8468	
  8469	Where was I?  Where was I?  I must know at any cost.  I tried to speak,
  8470	but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of
  8471	chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one
  8472	word:
  8473	
  8474	
  8475	ATLANTIS
  8476	
  8477	
  8478	What a light shot through my mind!  Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,
  8479	that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its
  8480	disappearance amongst the legendary tales.  I had it there now before
  8481	my eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its
  8482	catastrophe.  The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and
  8483	Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the
  8484	Atlantides, lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were
  8485	waged.
  8486	
  8487	Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the
  8488	mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a
  8489	thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs.
  8490	I was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first
  8491	man had walked.
  8492	
  8493	Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand
  8494	landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute
  8495	ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone.  Was he dreaming of those
  8496	generations long since disappeared?  Was he asking them the secret of
  8497	human destiny?  Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in
  8498	historical recollections, and live again this ancient life--he who
  8499	wanted no modern one?  What would I not have given to know his
  8500	thoughts, to share them, to understand them!  We remained for an hour
  8501	at this place, contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of
  8502	the lava, which was some times wonderfully intense.  Rapid tremblings
  8503	ran along the mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise,
  8504	distinctly transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with
  8505	majestic grandeur.  At this moment the moon appeared through the mass
  8506	of waters and threw her pale rays on the buried continent.  It was but
  8507	a gleam, but what an indescribable effect!  The Captain rose, cast one
  8508	last look on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.
  8509	
  8510	We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,
  8511	I saw the lantern of the Nautilus shining like a star.  The Captain
  8512	walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light
  8513	whitened the surface of the ocean.
  8514	
  8515	
  8516	
  8517	CHAPTER X
  8518	
  8519	THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES
  8520	
  8521	The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late:  the fatigues of
  8522	the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o'clock. I
  8523	dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the Nautilus was
  8524	taking.  The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a
  8525	speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.
  8526	
  8527	The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already
  8528	noticed.  There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed
  8529	with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the
  8530	waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,
  8531	with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost
  8532	invisible in the water.
  8533	
  8534	Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at
  8535	the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,
  8536	known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are
  8537	dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.
  8538	
  8539	About four o'clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed
  8540	with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and
  8541	seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling
  8542	of lava.  I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long
  8543	plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the Nautilus, I saw
  8544	the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close all
  8545	exit.  Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean.  It must be
  8546	a continent, or at least an island--one of the Canaries, or of the Cape
  8547	Verde Islands.  The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps designedly, I
  8548	was ignorant of our exact position.  In any case, such a wall seemed to
  8549	me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had in reality
  8550	passed over only the smallest part.
  8551	
  8552	Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties
  8553	of sea and sky, but the panels closed.  At this moment the Nautilus
  8554	arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall.  What it would
  8555	do, I could not guess.  I returned to my room; it no longer moved.  I
  8556	laid myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours'
  8557	sleep; but it was eight o'clock the next day when I entered the saloon.
  8558	I looked at the manometer.  It told me that the Nautilus was floating
  8559	on the surface of the ocean.  Besides, I heard steps on the platform.
  8560	I went to the panel.  It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I
  8561	expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness.  Where were we?  Was I
  8562	mistaken?  Was it still night?  No; not a star was shining and night
  8563	has not that utter darkness.
  8564	
  8565	I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:
  8566	
  8567	"Is that you, Professor?"
  8568	
  8569	"Ah!  Captain," I answered, "where are we?"
  8570	
  8571	"Underground, sir."
  8572	
  8573	"Underground!"  I exclaimed.  "And the Nautilus floating still?"
  8574	
  8575	"It always floats."
  8576	
  8577	"But I do not understand."
  8578	
  8579	"Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light
  8580	places, you will be satisfied."
  8581	
  8582	I stood on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so complete that
  8583	I could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly
  8584	above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight
  8585	filling a circular hole.  At this instant the lantern was lit, and its
  8586	vividness dispelled the faint light.  I closed my dazzled eyes for an
  8587	instant, and then looked again.  The Nautilus was stationary, floating
  8588	near a mountain which formed a sort of quay.  The lake, then,
  8589	supporting it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two
  8590	miles in diameter and six in circumference.  Its level (the manometer
  8591	showed) could only be the same as the outside level, for there must
  8592	necessarily be a communication between the lake and the sea.  The high
  8593	partitions, leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof
  8594	bearing the shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height
  8595	being about five or six hundred yards.  At the summit was a circular
  8596	orifice, by which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently
  8597	daylight.
  8598	
  8599	"Where are we?"  I asked.
  8600	
  8601	"In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has
  8602	been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.
  8603	Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the Nautilus penetrated to this
  8604	lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the
  8605	surface of the ocean.  This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,
  8606	commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales.  Show me, if
  8607	you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road
  8608	which can give such perfect refuge from all storms."
  8609	
  8610	"Certainly," I replied, "you are in safety here, Captain Nemo.  Who
  8611	could reach you in the heart of a volcano?  But did I not see an
  8612	opening at its summit?"
  8613	
  8614	"Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and
  8615	which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe."
  8616	
  8617	"But what is this volcanic mountain?"
  8618	
  8619	"It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is
  8620	strewn--to vessels a simple sandbank--to us an immense cavern.  Chance
  8621	led me to discover it, and chance served me well."
  8622	
  8623	"But of what use is this refuge, Captain?  The Nautilus wants no port."
  8624	
  8625	"No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal
  8626	to make the electricity--sodium to feed the elements, coal from which
  8627	to get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal.  And exactly on
  8628	this spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological
  8629	periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an
  8630	inexhaustible mine."
  8631	
  8632	"Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?"
  8633	
  8634	"Exactly so.  These mines extend under the waves like the mines of
  8635	Newcastle.  Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,
  8636	my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the
  8637	earth.  When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the
  8638	smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the
  8639	appearance of a still-active volcano."
  8640	
  8641	"And we shall see your companions at work?"
  8642	
  8643	"No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our
  8644	submarine tour of the earth.  So I shall content myself with drawing
  8645	from the reserve of sodium I already possess.  The time for loading is
  8646	one day only, and we continue our voyage.  So, if you wish to go over
  8647	the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of
  8648	to-day, M. Aronnax."
  8649	
  8650	I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not
  8651	yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me without saying where
  8652	we were.  They mounted the platform.  Conseil, who was astonished at
  8653	nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake
  8654	under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves.  But Ned
  8655	Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.
  8656	After breakfast, about ten o'clock, we went down on to the mountain.
  8657	
  8658	"Here we are, once more on land," said Conseil.
  8659	
  8660	"I do not call this land," said the Canadian.  "And besides, we are not
  8661	on it, but beneath it."
  8662	
  8663	Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a
  8664	sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.
  8665	On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake.  But the base
  8666	of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and
  8667	enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps.  All these detached
  8668	masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the
  8669	subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric
  8670	lantern.  The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew
  8671	like a cloud of sparks.  The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon
  8672	arrived at long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us
  8673	higher by degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these
  8674	conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy
  8675	crystal, felspar, and quartz.
  8676	
  8677	The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all
  8678	sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.
  8679	
  8680	"Picture to yourselves," said I, "what this crater must have been when
  8681	filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid
  8682	rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a
  8683	hot plate."
  8684	
  8685	"I can picture it perfectly," said Conseil.  "But, sir, will you tell
  8686	me why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that
  8687	the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?"
  8688	
  8689	"Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean
  8690	produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the
  8691	Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of
  8692	the mountain.  There must have been a terrible struggle between the two
  8693	elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune.  But many
  8694	ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a
  8695	peaceable grotto."
  8696	
  8697	"Very well," replied Ned Land; "I accept the explanation, sir; but, in
  8698	our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not
  8699	made above the level of the sea."
  8700	
  8701	"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "if the passage had not been under the
  8702	sea, the Nautilus could not have gone through it."
  8703	
  8704	We continued ascending.  The steps became more and more perpendicular
  8705	and narrow.  Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them
  8706	here and there; sloping masses had to be turned.  We slid upon our
  8707	knees and crawled along.  But Conseil's dexterity and the Canadian's
  8708	strength surmounted all obstacles.  At a height of about 31 feet the
  8709	nature of the ground changed without becoming more practicable.  To the
  8710	conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in
  8711	layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like
  8712	a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable
  8713	specimen of natural architecture.  Between the blocks of basalt wound
  8714	long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous
  8715	rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur.  A
  8716	more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague
  8717	glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of
  8718	this extinguished mountain.  But our upward march was soon stopped at a
  8719	height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.
  8720	There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was
  8721	changed to a circular walk.  At the last change vegetable life began to
  8722	struggle with the mineral.  Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from
  8723	the fractures of the walls.  I recognised some euphorbias, with the
  8724	caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of
  8725	justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both
  8726	their colour and perfume half gone.  Here and there some chrysanthemums
  8727	grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.
  8728	But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still
  8729	slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight.  Perfume
  8730	is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.
  8731	
  8732	We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had
  8733	pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land exclaimed:
  8734	
  8735	"Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!"
  8736	
  8737	"A hive!"  I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.
  8738	
  8739	"Yes, a hive," repeated the Canadian, "and bees humming round it."
  8740	
  8741	I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes.  There at a hole
  8742	bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious
  8743	insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much
  8744	esteemed.  Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,
  8745	and I could not well oppose his wish.  A quantity of dry leaves, mixed
  8746	with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke
  8747	out the bees.  The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually
  8748	yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land
  8749	filled his haversack.
  8750	
  8751	"When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit," said
  8752	he, "I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake."
  8753	
  8754	[Transcriber's Note: 'bread-fruit' has been substituted for
  8755	'artocarpus' in this ed.]
  8756	
  8757	"'Pon my word," said Conseil, "it will be gingerbread."
  8758	
  8759	"Never mind the gingerbread," said I; "let us continue our interesting
  8760	walk."
  8761	
  8762	At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all
  8763	its length and breadth.  The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable
  8764	surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave.  The Nautilus remained
  8765	perfectly immovable.  On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship's
  8766	crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the
  8767	luminous atmosphere.  We were now going round the highest crest of the
  8768	first layers of rock which upheld the roof.  I then saw that bees were
  8769	not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of
  8770	this volcano.  Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or
  8771	fled from their nests on the top of the rocks.  There were sparrow
  8772	hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,
  8773	with their long legs, several fine fat bustards.  I leave anyone to
  8774	imagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury
  8775	game, and whether he did not regret having no gun.  But he did his best
  8776	to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,
  8777	he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird.  To say that he risked his
  8778	life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed
  8779	so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag.  We were
  8780	now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming
  8781	impracticable.  Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a
  8782	well.  From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,
  8783	dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of
  8784	the mountain, their misty remnants--certain proof that they were only
  8785	moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred
  8786	feet above the level of the ocean.  Half an hour after the Canadian's
  8787	last exploit we had regained the inner shore.  Here the flora was
  8788	represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous
  8789	plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone
  8790	and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  As to the fauna,
  8791	it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,
  8792	crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,
  8793	rockfish, and limpets.  Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished
  8794	our circuitous walk and were on board.  The crew had just finished
  8795	loading the sodium, and the Nautilus could have left that instant.  But
  8796	Captain Nemo gave no order.  Did he wish to wait until night, and leave
  8797	the submarine passage secretly?  Perhaps so.  Whatever it might be, the
  8798	next day, the Nautilus, having left its port, steered clear of all land
  8799	at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.

  8803	CHAPTER XI
  8804	
  8805	THE SARGASSO SEA
  8806	
  8807	That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.
  8808	No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water
  8809	known by the name of the Gulf Stream.  After leaving the Gulf of
  8810	Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen.  But before entering
  8811	the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into
  8812	two arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and
  8813	Norway, whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the
  8814	Azores; then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened
  8815	oval, returns to the Antilles.  This second arm--it is rather a collar
  8816	than an arm--surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of
  8817	the cold, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect
  8818	lake in the open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the
  8819	great current to pass round it.  Such was the region the Nautilus was
  8820	now visiting, a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and
  8821	tropical berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel
  8822	could hardly tear its way through it.  And Captain Nemo, not wishing to
  8823	entangle his screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the
  8824	surface of the waves.  The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word
  8825	"sargazzo" which signifies kelp.  This kelp, or berry-plant, is the
  8826	principal formation of this immense bank.  And this is the reason why
  8827	these plants unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic.  The only
  8828	explanation which can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the
  8829	experience known to all the world.  Place in a vase some fragments of
  8830	cork or other floating body, and give to the water in the vase a
  8831	circular movement, the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the
  8832	centre of the liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least
  8833	agitated.  In the phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the
  8834	vase, the Gulf Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the
  8835	central point at which the floating bodies unite.
  8836	
  8837	I share Maury's opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the
  8838	very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate.  Above us floated products
  8839	of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees
  8840	torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon
  8841	or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships'
  8842	bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and
  8843	barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface.  And time will
  8844	one day justify Maury's other opinion, that these substances thus
  8845	accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water
  8846	and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines--a precious reserve
  8847	prepared by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have
  8848	exhausted the mines of continents.
  8849	
  8850	In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I
  8851	noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long
  8852	tentacles trailing after them, and medusae, green, red, and blue.
  8853	
  8854	All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,
  8855	where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant
  8856	nourishment.  The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed
  8857	aspect.  From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to
  8858	the 12th of March, the Nautilus kept in the middle of the Atlantic,
  8859	carrying us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four
  8860	hours.  Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine
  8861	programme, and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,
  8862	to return to the Australian seas of the Pacific.  Ned Land had cause
  8863	for fear.  In these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt
  8864	to leave the boat.  Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo's
  8865	will.  Our only course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by
  8866	force nor cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion.
  8867	This voyage ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under
  8868	an oath never to reveal his existence?--an oath of honour which we
  8869	should have religiously kept.  But we must consider that delicate
  8870	question with the Captain.  But was I free to claim this liberty?  Had
  8871	he not himself said from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the
  8872	secret of his life exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board
  8873	the Nautilus?  And would not my four months' silence appear to him a
  8874	tacit acceptance of our situation?  And would not a return to the
  8875	subject result in raising suspicions which might be hurtful to our
  8876	projects, if at some future time a favourable opportunity offered to
  8877	return to them?
  8878	
  8879	During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind
  8880	happened to signalise our voyage.  I saw little of the Captain; he was
  8881	at work.  In the library I often found his books left open, especially
  8882	those on natural history.  My work on submarine depths, conned over by
  8883	him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories
  8884	and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my
  8885	work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me.  Sometimes I
  8886	heard the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the
  8887	midst of the deepest obscurity, when the Nautilus slept upon the
  8888	deserted ocean.  During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on
  8889	the surface of the waves.  The sea seemed abandoned.  A few
  8890	sailing-vessels, on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good
  8891	Hope.  One day we were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no
  8892	doubt, took us for some enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo
  8893	did not wish the worthy fellows to lose their time and trouble, so
  8894	ended the chase by plunging under the water.  Our navigation continued
  8895	until the 13th of March; that day the Nautilus was employed in taking
  8896	soundings, which greatly interested me.  We had then made about 13,000
  8897	leagues since our departure from the high seas of the Pacific.  The
  8898	bearings gave us 45° 37' S. lat., and 37° 53' W. long.  It was
  8899	the same water in which Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000
  8900	fathoms without finding the bottom.  There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of
  8901	the American frigate Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140
  8902	fathoms.  Captain Nemo intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a
  8903	diagonal sufficiently lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at
  8904	an angle of 45° with the water-line of the Nautilus.  Then the
  8905	screw set to work at its maximum speed, its four blades beating the
  8906	waves with in describable force.  Under this powerful pressure, the
  8907	hull of the Nautilus quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly
  8908	under the water.
  8909	
  8910	At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the
  8911	waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the
  8912	Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss
  8913	remained incalculable.  The Nautilus descended still lower, in spite of
  8914	the great pressure.  I felt the steel plates tremble at the fastenings
  8915	of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the windows of the
  8916	saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.  And this firm
  8917	structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its Captain had said, it
  8918	had not been capable of resistance like a solid block.  We had attained
  8919	a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the sides of the Nautilus
  8920	then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that is to say, 3,200 lb.
  8921	to each square two-fifths of an inch of its surface.
  8922	
  8923	"What a situation to be in!"  I exclaimed.  "To overrun these deep
  8924	regions where man has never trod!  Look, Captain, look at these
  8925	magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles
  8926	of the globe, where life is no longer possible!  What unknown sights
  8927	are here!  Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?"
  8928	
  8929	"Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?" said Captain
  8930	Nemo.
  8931	
  8932	"What do you mean by those words?"
  8933	
  8934	"I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view
  8935	of this submarine region."
  8936	
  8937	I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at
  8938	Captain Nemo's call, an objective was brought into the saloon.  Through
  8939	the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,
  8940	which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a
  8941	gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light.  The Nautilus
  8942	remained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination
  8943	of its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic
  8944	site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.
  8945	
  8946	But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, "Let us go up; we
  8947	must not abuse our position, nor expose the Nautilus too long to such
  8948	great pressure."
  8949	
  8950	"Go up again!"  I exclaimed.
  8951	
  8952	"Hold well on."
  8953	
  8954	I had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I
  8955	was thrown forward on to the carpet.  At a signal from the Captain, its
  8956	screw was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the Nautilus shot
  8957	into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and cutting
  8958	the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation.  Nothing was visible; and
  8959	in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which separated it
  8960	from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish, fell, making
  8961	the waves rebound to an enormous height.
  8962	
  8963	
  8964	
  8965	CHAPTER XII
  8966	
  8967	CACHALOTS AND WHALES
  8968	
  8969	During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the Nautilus returned
  8970	to its southerly course.  I fancied that, when on a level with Cape
  8971	Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the Pacific
  8972	seas, and so complete the tour of the world.  He did nothing of the
  8973	kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions.  Where was he
  8974	going to?  To the pole?  It was madness!  I began to think that the
  8975	Captain's temerity justified Ned Land's fears.  For some time past the
  8976	Canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less
  8977	communicative, almost silent.  I could see that this lengthened
  8978	imprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning
  8979	within him.  When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed
  8980	anger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some
  8981	extreme.  That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my
  8982	room.  I inquired the cause of their visit.
  8983	
  8984	"A simple question to ask you, sir," replied the Canadian.
  8985	
  8986	"Speak, Ned."
  8987	
  8988	"How many men are there on board the Nautilus, do you think?"
  8989	
  8990	"I cannot tell, my friend."
  8991	
  8992	"I should say that its working does not require a large crew."
  8993	
  8994	"Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to
  8995	be enough."
  8996	
  8997	"Well, why should there be any more?"
  8998	
  8999	"Why?"  I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy
  9000	to guess.  "Because," I added, "if my surmises are correct, and if I
  9001	have well understood the Captain's existence, the Nautilus is not only
  9002	a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its
  9003	commander, have broken every tie upon earth."
  9004	
  9005	"Perhaps so," said Conseil; "but, in any case, the Nautilus can only
  9006	contain a certain number of men.  Could not you, sir, estimate their
  9007	maximum?"
  9008	
  9009	"How, Conseil?"
  9010	
  9011	"By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and
  9012	consequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much
  9013	each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact
  9014	that the Nautilus is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four
  9015	hours."
  9016	
  9017	Conseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving
  9018	at.
  9019	
  9020	"I understand," said I; "but that calculation, though simple enough,
  9021	can give but a very uncertain result."
  9022	
  9023	"Never mind," said Ned Land urgently.
  9024	
  9025	"Here it is, then," said I. "In one hour each man consumes the oxygen
  9026	contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained
  9027	in 480 gallons.  We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of
  9028	air the Nautilus contains."
  9029	
  9030	"Just so," said Conseil.
  9031	
  9032	"Or," I continued, "the size of the Nautilus being 1,500 tons; and one
  9033	ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,
  9034	divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625.  Which means to say, strictly
  9035	speaking, that the air contained in the Nautilus would suffice for 625
  9036	men for twenty-four hours."
  9037	
  9038	"Six hundred and twenty-five!" repeated Ned.
  9039	
  9040	"But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers
  9041	included, would not form a tenth part of that number."
  9042	
  9043	"Still too many for three men," murmured Conseil.
  9044	
  9045	The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and
  9046	left the room without answering.
  9047	
  9048	"Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?" said Conseil.  "Poor
  9049	Ned is longing for everything that he can not have.  His past life is
  9050	always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets.
  9051	His head is full of old recollections.  And we must understand him.
  9052	What has he to do here?  Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and
  9053	has not the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have.  He
  9054	would risk everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his
  9055	own country."
  9056	
  9057	Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,
  9058	accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity.  Events were
  9059	rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event
  9060	did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner.  About
  9061	eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the Nautilus
  9062	fell in with a troop of whales--an encounter which did not astonish me,
  9063	knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken refuge in high
  9064	latitudes.
  9065	
  9066	We were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea.  The month of October
  9067	in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days.  It was the
  9068	Canadian--he could not be mistaken--who signalled a whale on the
  9069	eastern horizon.  Looking attentively, one might see its black back
  9070	rise and fall with the waves five miles from the Nautilus.
  9071	
  9072	"Ah!" exclaimed Ned Land, "if I was on board a whaler, now such a
  9073	meeting would give me pleasure.  It is one of large size.  See with
  9074	what strength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam!
  9075	Confound it, why am I bound to these steel plates?"
  9076	
  9077	"What, Ned," said I, "you have not forgotten your old ideas of fishing?"
  9078	
  9079	"Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir?  Can he ever tire
  9080	of the emotions caused by such a chase?"
  9081	
  9082	"You have never fished in these seas, Ned?"
  9083	
  9084	"Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis
  9085	Straits."
  9086	
  9087	"Then the southern whale is still unknown to you.  It is the Greenland
  9088	whale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing
  9089	through the warm waters of the equator.  Whales are localised,
  9090	according to their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave.  And
  9091	if one of these creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must
  9092	be simply because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either
  9093	on the American or the Asiatic side."
  9094	
  9095	"In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the
  9096	kind of whale frequenting them!"
  9097	
  9098	"I have told you, Ned."
  9099	
  9100	"A greater reason for making their acquaintance," said Conseil.
  9101	
  9102	"Look! look!" exclaimed the Canadian, "they approach: they aggravate
  9103	me; they know that I cannot get at them!"
  9104	
  9105	Ned stamped his feet.  His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary
  9106	harpoon.
  9107	
  9108	"Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?" asked he.
  9109	
  9110	"Very nearly, Ned."
  9111	
  9112	"Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred
  9113	feet.  I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of
  9114	the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long."
  9115	
  9116	"That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only
  9117	balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are
  9118	generally much smaller than the Greenland whale."
  9119	
  9120	"Ah!" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,
  9121	"they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the Nautilus."
  9122	
  9123	Then, returning to the conversation, he said:
  9124	
  9125	"You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature.  I have heard of
  9126	gigantic ones.  They are intelligent cetacea.  It is said of some that
  9127	they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for
  9128	islands.  People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire----"
  9129	
  9130	"And build houses," said Conseil.
  9131	
  9132	"Yes, joker," said Ned Land.  "And one fine day the creature plunges,
  9133	carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea."
  9134	
  9135	"Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor," I replied, laughing.
  9136	
  9137	"Ah!" suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, "it is not one whale; there are
  9138	ten--there are twenty--it is a whole troop!  And I not able to do
  9139	anything! hands and feet tied!"
  9140	
  9141	"But, friend Ned," said Conseil, "why do you not ask Captain Nemo's
  9142	permission to chase them?"
  9143	
  9144	Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself
  9145	through the panel to seek the Captain.  A few minutes afterwards the
  9146	two appeared together on the platform.
  9147	
  9148	Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a
  9149	mile from the Nautilus.
  9150	
  9151	"They are southern whales," said he; "there goes the fortune of a whole
  9152	fleet of whalers."
  9153	
  9154	"Well, sir," asked the Canadian, "can I not chase them, if only to
  9155	remind me of my old trade of harpooner?"
  9156	
  9157	"And to what purpose?" replied Captain Nemo; "only to destroy!  We have
  9158	nothing to do with the whale-oil on board."
  9159	
  9160	"But, sir," continued the Canadian, "in the Red Sea you allowed us to
  9161	follow the dugong."
  9162	
  9163	"Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew.  Here it would be
  9164	killing for killing's sake.  I know that is a privilege reserved for
  9165	man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime.  In destroying the
  9166	southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),
  9167	your traders do a culpable action, Master Land.  They have already
  9168	depopulated the whole of Baffin's Bay, and are annihilating a class of
  9169	useful animals.  Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone.  They have plenty
  9170	of natural enemies--cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish--without you
  9171	troubling them."
  9172	
  9173	The Captain was right.  The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these
  9174	fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the
  9175	ocean.  Ned Land whistled "Yankee-doodle" between his teeth, thrust his
  9176	hands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us.  But Captain Nemo
  9177	watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:
  9178	
  9179	"I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without
  9180	counting man.  These will have plenty to do before long.  Do you see,
  9181	M. Aronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?"
  9182	
  9183	"Yes, Captain," I replied.
  9184	
  9185	"Those are cachalots--terrible animals, which I have met in troops of
  9186	two or three hundred.  As to those, they are cruel, mischievous
  9187	creatures; they would be right in exterminating them."
  9188	
  9189	The Canadian turned quickly at the last words.
  9190	
  9191	"Well, Captain," said he, "it is still time, in the interest of the
  9192	whales."
  9193	
  9194	"It is useless to expose one's self, Professor.  The Nautilus will
  9195	disperse them.  It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land's
  9196	harpoon, I imagine."
  9197	
  9198	The Canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders.
  9199	Attack cetacea with blows of a spur!  Who had ever heard of such a
  9200	thing?
  9201	
  9202	"Wait, M. Aronnax," said Captain Nemo.  "We will show you something you
  9203	have never yet seen.  We have no pity for these ferocious creatures.
  9204	They are nothing but mouth and teeth."
  9205	
  9206	Mouth and teeth!  No one could better describe the macrocephalous
  9207	cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long.  Its
  9208	enormous head occupies one-third of its entire body.  Better armed than
  9209	the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is
  9210	supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,
  9211	cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds.  It is in
  9212	the upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by
  9213	cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of
  9214	that precious oil called spermaceti.  The cachalot is a disagreeable
  9215	creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol's description.
  9216	It is badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say
  9217	it), a "failure," and being only able to see with its right eye.  But
  9218	the formidable troop was nearing us.  They had seen the whales and were
  9219	preparing to attack them.  One could judge beforehand that the
  9220	cachalots would be victorious, not only because they were better built
  9221	for attack than their inoffensive adversaries, but also because they
  9222	could remain longer under water without coming to the surface.  There
  9223	was only just time to go to the help of the whales.  The Nautilus went
  9224	under water.  Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the
  9225	window in the saloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to
  9226	work his apparatus as an engine of destruction.  Soon I felt the
  9227	beatings of the screw quicken, and our speed increased.  The battle
  9228	between the cachalots and the whales had already begun when the
  9229	Nautilus arrived.  They did not at first show any fear at the sight of
  9230	this new monster joining in the conflict.  But they soon had to guard
  9231	against its blows.  What a battle!  The Nautilus was nothing but a
  9232	formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand of its Captain.  It hurled
  9233	itself against the fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the
  9234	other, leaving behind it two quivering halves of the animal.  It could
  9235	not feel the formidable blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the
  9236	shock which it produced itself, much more.  One cachalot killed, it ran
  9237	at the next, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey, going
  9238	forwards and backwards, answering to its helm, plunging when the
  9239	cetacean dived into the deep waters, coming up with it when it returned
  9240	to the surface, striking it front or sideways, cutting or tearing in
  9241	all directions and at any pace, piercing it with its terrible spur.
  9242	What carnage!  What a noise on the surface of the waves!  What sharp
  9243	hissing, and what snorting peculiar to these enraged animals!  In the
  9244	midst of these waters, generally so peaceful, their tails made perfect
  9245	billows.  For one hour this wholesale massacre continued, from which
  9246	the cachalots could not escape.  Several times ten or twelve united
  9247	tried to crush the Nautilus by their weight.  From the window we could
  9248	see their enormous mouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable
  9249	eyes.  Ned Land could not contain himself; he threatened and swore at
  9250	them.  We could feel them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a
  9251	wild boar in a copse.  But the Nautilus, working its screw, carried
  9252	them here and there, or to the upper levels of the ocean, without
  9253	caring for their enormous weight, nor the powerful strain on the
  9254	vessel.  At length the mass of cachalots broke up, the waves became
  9255	quiet, and I felt that we were rising to the surface.  The panel
  9256	opened, and we hurried on to the platform.  The sea was covered with
  9257	mutilated bodies.  A formidable explosion could not have divided and
  9258	torn this fleshy mass with more violence.  We were floating amid
  9259	gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and white underneath, covered with
  9260	enormous protuberances.  Some terrified cachalots were flying towards
  9261	the horizon.  The waves were dyed red for several miles, and the
  9262	Nautilus floated in a sea of blood:  Captain Nemo joined us.
  9263	
  9264	"Well, Master Land?" said he.
  9265	
  9266	"Well, sir," replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat
  9267	calmed; "it is a terrible spectacle, certainly.  But I am not a
  9268	butcher.  I am a hunter, and I call this a butchery."
  9269	
  9270	"It is a massacre of mischievous creatures," replied the Captain; "and
  9271	the Nautilus is not a butcher's knife."
  9272	
  9273	"I like my harpoon better," said the Canadian.
  9274	
  9275	"Every one to his own," answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned
  9276	Land.
  9277	
  9278	I feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad
  9279	consequences.  But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which
  9280	the Nautilus had just come up with.  The creature had not quite escaped
  9281	from the cachalot's teeth.  I recognised the southern whale by its flat
  9282	head, which is entirely black.  Anatomically, it is distinguished from
  9283	the white whale and the North Cape whale by the seven cervical
  9284	vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.  The
  9285	unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from the
  9286	bites, and quite dead.  From its mutilated fin still hung a young whale
  9287	which it could not save from the massacre.  Its open mouth let the
  9288	water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.
  9289	Captain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature.  Two of his
  9290	men mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were
  9291	drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to
  9292	say, about two or three tons.  The Captain offered me a cup of the
  9293	milk, which was still warm.  I could not help showing my repugnance to
  9294	the drink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be
  9295	distinguished from cow's milk.  I tasted it, and was of his opinion.
  9296	It was a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or
  9297	cheese it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food.  From
  9298	that day I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land's ill-will towards
  9299	Captain Nemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian's gestures
  9300	closely.
  9301	
  9302	
  9303	
  9304	CHAPTER XIII
  9305	
  9306	THE ICEBERG
  9307	
  9308	The Nautilus was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following the
  9309	fiftieth meridian with considerable speed.  Did he wish to reach the
  9310	pole?  I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had
  9311	hitherto failed.  Again, the season was far advanced, for in the
  9312	Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of
  9313	September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.
  9314	On the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely
  9315	pale bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks
  9316	over which the sea curled.  The Nautilus remained on the surface of the
  9317	ocean.  Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with
  9318	its icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time.  In
  9319	the atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling
  9320	band.  English whalers have given it the name of "ice blink."  However
  9321	thick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the
  9322	presence of an ice pack or bank.  Accordingly, larger blocks soon
  9323	appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog.  Some
  9324	of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had
  9325	been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous
  9326	amethysts with the light shining through them.  Some reflected the
  9327	light of day upon a thousand crystal facets.  Others shaded with vivid
  9328	calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble.  The more we
  9329	neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in
  9330	number and importance.
  9331	
  9332	At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared.  But, seeking carefully,
  9333	Captain Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly
  9334	slipped, knowing, however, that it would close behind him.  Thus,
  9335	guided by this clever hand, the Nautilus passed through all the ice
  9336	with a precision which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains,
  9337	ice-fields or smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or
  9338	floating ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are
  9339	circular, and streams when they are made up of long strips.  The
  9340	temperature was very low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2
  9341	deg. or 3° below zero, but we were warmly clad with fur, at the
  9342	expense of the sea-bear and seal.  The interior of the Nautilus, warmed
  9343	regularly by its electric apparatus, defied the most intense cold.
  9344	Besides, it would only have been necessary to go some yards beneath the
  9345	waves to find a more bearable temperature.  Two months earlier we
  9346	should have had perpetual daylight in these latitudes; but already we
  9347	had had three or four hours of night, and by and by there would be six
  9348	months of darkness in these circumpolar regions.  On the 15th of March
  9349	we were in the latitude of New Shetland and South Orkney.  The Captain
  9350	told me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that
  9351	English and American whalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred
  9352	both old and young; thus, where there was once life and animation, they
  9353	had left silence and death.
  9354	
  9355	About eight o'clock on the morning of the 16th of March the Nautilus,
  9356	following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle.
  9357	Ice surrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon.  But Captain
  9358	Nemo went from one opening to another, still going higher.  I cannot
  9359	express my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions.  The ice
  9360	took most surprising forms.  Here the grouping formed an oriental town,
  9361	with innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to
  9362	the earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature.  The whole aspect
  9363	was constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the
  9364	greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow.  Detonations and falls were
  9365	heard on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the
  9366	whole landscape like a diorama.  Often seeing no exit, I thought we
  9367	were definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest
  9368	indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass.  He was never
  9369	mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along
  9370	the ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into
  9371	the midst of these Antarctic seas before.  On the 16th of March,
  9372	however, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road.  It was not the
  9373	iceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold.  But this
  9374	obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with
  9375	frightful violence.  The Nautilus entered the brittle mass like a
  9376	wedge, and split it with frightful crackings.  It was the battering ram
  9377	of the ancients hurled by infinite strength.  The ice, thrown high in
  9378	the air, fell like hail around us.  By its own power of impulsion our
  9379	apparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own
  9380	impetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and
  9381	sometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,
  9382	producing large rents in it.  Violent gales assailed us at this time,
  9383	accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform
  9384	to the other, we could see nothing.  The wind blew sharply from all
  9385	parts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had
  9386	to break it with blows of a pickaxe.  The temperature was always at 5
  9387	deg. below zero; every outward part of the Nautilus was covered with
  9388	ice.  A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up
  9389	gorges.  A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,
  9390	and wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes.  At length,
  9391	on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the Nautilus was
  9392	positively blocked.  It was no longer either streams, packs, or
  9393	ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by
  9394	mountains soldered together.
  9395	
  9396	"An iceberg!" said the Canadian to me.
  9397	
  9398	I knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had
  9399	preceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle.  The sun appearing for an
  9400	instant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,
  9401	which gave our situation at 51° 30' long. and 67° 39' of S.
  9402	lat.  We had advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region.  Of the
  9403	liquid surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse.  Under the
  9404	spur of the Nautilus lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with
  9405	confused blocks.  Here and there sharp points and slender needles
  9406	rising to a height of 200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it
  9407	were with an axe and clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors,
  9408	reflecting a few rays of sunshine, half drowned in the fog.  And over
  9409	this desolate face of nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken
  9410	by the flapping of the wings of petrels and puffins.  Everything was
  9411	frozen--even the noise.  The Nautilus was then obliged to stop in its
  9412	adventurous course amid these fields of ice.  In spite of our efforts,
  9413	in spite of the powerful means employed to break up the ice, the
  9414	Nautilus remained immovable.  Generally, when we can proceed no
  9415	further, we have return still open to us; but here return was as
  9416	impossible as advance, for every pass had closed behind us; and for the
  9417	few moments when we were stationary, we were likely to be entirely
  9418	blocked, which did indeed happen about two o'clock in the afternoon,
  9419	the fresh ice forming around its sides with astonishing rapidity.  I
  9420	was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more than imprudent.  I was
  9421	on the platform at that moment.  The Captain had been observing our
  9422	situation for some time past, when he said to me:
  9423	
  9424	"Well, sir, what do you think of this?"
  9425	
  9426	"I think that we are caught, Captain."
  9427	
  9428	"So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the Nautilus cannot disengage
  9429	itself?"
  9430	
  9431	"With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced
  9432	for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice."
  9433	
  9434	"Ah! sir," said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, "you will always be
  9435	the same.  You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles.  I affirm
  9436	that not only can the Nautilus disengage itself, but also that it can
  9437	go further still."
  9438	
  9439	"Further to the South?"  I asked, looking at the Captain.
  9440	
  9441	"Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole."
  9442	
  9443	"To the pole!"  I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.
  9444	
  9445	"Yes," replied the Captain, coldly, "to the Antarctic pole--to that
  9446	unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe.  You
  9447	know whether I can do as I please with the Nautilus!"
  9448	
  9449	Yes, I knew that.  I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness.
  9450	But to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,
  9451	rendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been
  9452	reached by the boldest navigators--was it not a mad enterprise, one
  9453	which only a maniac would have conceived?  It then came into my head to
  9454	ask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never
  9455	yet been trodden by a human creature?
  9456	
  9457	"No, sir," he replied; "but we will discover it together.  Where others
  9458	have failed, I will not fail.  I have never yet led my Nautilus so far
  9459	into southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet."
  9460	
  9461	"I can well believe you, Captain," said I, in a slightly ironical tone.
  9462	"I believe you!  Let us go ahead!  There are no obstacles for us!  Let
  9463	us smash this iceberg!  Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us
  9464	give the Nautilus wings to fly over it!"
  9465	
  9466	"Over it, sir!" said Captain Nemo, quietly; "no, not over it, but under
  9467	it!"
  9468	
  9469	"Under it!"  I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain's projects
  9470	flashing upon my mind.  I understood; the wonderful qualities of the
  9471	Nautilus were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.
  9472	
  9473	"I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir," said the
  9474	Captain, half smiling.  "You begin to see the possibility--I should say
  9475	the success--of this attempt.  That which is impossible for an ordinary
  9476	vessel is easy to the Nautilus.  If a continent lies before the pole,
  9477	it must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is
  9478	washed by open sea, it will go even to the pole."
  9479	
  9480	"Certainly," said I, carried away by the Captain's reasoning; "if the
  9481	surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free
  9482	by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the
  9483	waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am
  9484	not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is
  9485	as one to four to that which is below."
  9486	
  9487	"Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are
  9488	three below it.  If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet
  9489	above the surface, they are not more than 900 beneath.  And what are
  9490	900 feet to the Nautilus?"
  9491	
  9492	"Nothing, sir."
  9493	
  9494	"It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of
  9495	sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of
  9496	surface cold."
  9497	
  9498	"Just so, sir--just so," I replied, getting animated.
  9499	
  9500	"The only difficulty," continued Captain Nemo, "is that of remaining
  9501	several days without renewing our provision of air."
  9502	
  9503	"Is that all?  The Nautilus has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and
  9504	they will supply us with all the oxygen we want."
  9505	
  9506	"Well thought of, M. Aronnax," replied the Captain, smiling.  "But, not
  9507	wishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my
  9508	objections."
  9509	
  9510	"Have you any more to make?"
  9511	
  9512	"Only one.  It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that
  9513	it may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the
  9514	surface."
  9515	
  9516	"Good, sir! but do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with a
  9517	powerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields
  9518	of ice, which would open at the shocks."
  9519	
  9520	"Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day."
  9521	
  9522	"Besides, Captain," I added, enthusiastically, "why should we not find
  9523	the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North?  The frozen
  9524	poles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the
  9525	northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may
  9526	suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two
  9527	points of the globe."
  9528	
  9529	"I think so too, M. Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo.  "I only wish you
  9530	to observe that, after having made so many objections to my project,
  9531	you are now crushing me with arguments in its favour!"
  9532	
  9533	The preparations for this audacious attempt now began.  The powerful
  9534	pumps of the Nautilus were working air into the reservoirs and storing
  9535	it at high pressure.  About four o'clock, Captain Nemo announced the
  9536	closing of the panels on the platform.  I threw one last look at the
  9537	massive iceberg which we were going to cross.  The weather was clear,
  9538	the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below
  9539	zero; but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so
  9540	unbearable.  About ten men mounted the sides of the Nautilus, armed
  9541	with pickaxes to break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free.
  9542	The operation was quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very
  9543	thin.  We all went below.  The usual reservoirs were filled with the
  9544	newly-liberated water, and the Nautilus soon descended.  I had taken my
  9545	place with Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see
  9546	the lower beds of the Southern Ocean.  The thermometer went up, the
  9547	needle of the compass deviated on the dial.  At about 900 feet, as
  9548	Captain Nemo had foreseen, we were floating beneath the undulating
  9549	bottom of the iceberg.  But the Nautilus went lower still--it went to
  9550	the depth of four hundred fathoms.  The temperature of the water at the
  9551	surface showed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two.
  9552	I need not say the temperature of the Nautilus was raised by its
  9553	heating apparatus to a much higher degree; every manoeuvre was
  9554	accomplished with wonderful precision.
  9555	
  9556	"We shall pass it, if you please, sir," said Conseil.
  9557	
  9558	"I believe we shall," I said, in a tone of firm conviction.
  9559	
  9560	In this open sea, the Nautilus had taken its course direct to the pole,
  9561	without leaving the fifty-second meridian.  From 67° 30' to 90
  9562	deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;
  9563	that is, about five hundred leagues.  The Nautilus kept up a mean speed
  9564	of twenty-six miles an hour--the speed of an express train.  If that
  9565	was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.
  9566	
  9567	For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the
  9568	window.  The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was
  9569	deserted; fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only
  9570	found there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open
  9571	polar sea.  Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of
  9572	the long steel body.  About two in the morning I took some hours'
  9573	repose, and Conseil did the same.  In crossing the waist I did not meet
  9574	Captain Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot's cage.  The next
  9575	morning, the 19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon.
  9576	The electric log told me that the speed of the Nautilus had been
  9577	slackened.  It was then going towards the surface; but prudently
  9578	emptying its reservoirs very slowly.  My heart beat fast.  Were we
  9579	going to emerge and regain the open polar atmosphere?  No!  A shock
  9580	told me that the Nautilus had struck the bottom of the iceberg, still
  9581	very thick, judging from the deadened sound.  We had in deed "struck,"
  9582	to use a sea expression, but in an inverse sense, and at a thousand
  9583	feet deep.  This would give three thousand feet of ice above us; one
  9584	thousand being above the water-mark. The iceberg was then higher than
  9585	at its borders--not a very reassuring fact.  Several times that day the
  9586	Nautilus tried again, and every time it struck the wall which lay like
  9587	a ceiling above it.  Sometimes it met with but 900 yards, only 200 of
  9588	which rose above the surface.  It was twice the height it was when the
  9589	Nautilus had gone under the waves.  I carefully noted the different
  9590	depths, and thus obtained a submarine profile of the chain as it was
  9591	developed under the water.  That night no change had taken place in our
  9592	situation.  Still ice between four and five hundred yards in depth!  It
  9593	was evidently diminishing, but, still, what a thickness between us and
  9594	the surface of the ocean!  It was then eight.  According to the daily
  9595	custom on board the Nautilus, its air should have been renewed four
  9596	hours ago; but I did not suffer much, although Captain Nemo had not yet
  9597	made any demand upon his reserve of oxygen.  My sleep was painful that
  9598	night; hope and fear besieged me by turns: I rose several times.  The
  9599	groping of the Nautilus continued.  About three in the morning, I
  9600	noticed that the lower surface of the iceberg was only about fifty feet
  9601	deep.  One hundred and fifty feet now separated us from the surface of
  9602	the waters.  The iceberg was by degrees becoming an ice-field, the
  9603	mountain a plain.  My eyes never left the manometer.  We were still
  9604	rising diagonally to the surface, which sparkled under the electric
  9605	rays.  The iceberg was stretching both above and beneath into
  9606	lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting thinner.  At length,
  9607	at six in the morning of that memorable day, the 19th of March, the
  9608	door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo appeared.
  9609	
  9610	"The sea is open!!" was all he said.
  9611	
  9612	
  9613	
  9614	CHAPTER XIV
  9615	
  9616	THE SOUTH POLE
  9617	
  9618	I rushed on to the platform.  Yes! the open sea, with but a few
  9619	scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs--a long stretch of sea; a
  9620	world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,
  9621	which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.
  9622	The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero.  It was comparatively
  9623	spring, shut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass
  9624	was dimly seen on our northern horizon.
  9625	
  9626	"Are we at the pole?"  I asked the Captain, with a beating heart.
  9627	
  9628	"I do not know," he replied.  "At noon I will take our bearings."
  9629	
  9630	"But will the sun show himself through this fog?" said I, looking at
  9631	the leaden sky.
  9632	
  9633	"However little it shows, it will be enough," replied the Captain.
  9634	
  9635	About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred
  9636	and four yards.  We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be
  9637	strewn with banks.  One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours
  9638	later we had made the round of it.  It measured four or five miles in
  9639	circumference.  A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch
  9640	of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits.  The
  9641	existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury's theory.
  9642	The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and
  9643	the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous
  9644	size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic.  From this fact he
  9645	has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses
  9646	considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only
  9647	on the coasts.  According to these calculations, the mass of ice
  9648	surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of
  9649	which must be, at least, 2,500 miles.  But the Nautilus, for fear of
  9650	running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand
  9651	over which reared a superb heap of rocks.  The boat was launched; the
  9652	Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were
  9653	in it.  It was ten in the morning.  I had not seen Ned Land.  Doubtless
  9654	the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole.  A
  9655	few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.
  9656	Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.
  9657	
  9658	"Sir," said I to Captain Nemo, "to you belongs the honour of first
  9659	setting foot on this land."
  9660	
  9661	"Yes, sir," said the Captain, "and if I do not hesitate to tread this
  9662	South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a
  9663	trace there."
  9664	
  9665	Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand.  His heart beat with
  9666	emotion.  He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,
  9667	with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he
  9668	seemed to take possession of these southern regions.  After five
  9669	minutes passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.
  9670	
  9671	"When you like, sir."
  9672	
  9673	I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat.  For a
  9674	long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like
  9675	crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could
  9676	not mistake its volcanic origin.  In some parts, slight curls of smoke
  9677	emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost
  9678	nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high
  9679	acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles.  We
  9680	know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,
  9681	the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,
  9682	latitude 77° 32'. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed
  9683	to me much restricted.  Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some
  9684	microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed
  9685	between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on
  9686	little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to
  9687	the shore.  These constituted the meagre flora of this region.  The
  9688	shore was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets.  I also
  9689	saw myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which
  9690	a whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect
  9691	sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.
  9692	
  9693	There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind
  9694	which, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth
  9695	of more than 1,000 yards.  Then there were little kingfishers and
  9696	starfish studding the soil.  But where life abounded most was in the
  9697	air.  There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,
  9698	deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us
  9699	as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our
  9700	feet.  There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as
  9701	they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large
  9702	assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour.  Albatrosses
  9703	passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards
  9704	and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic
  9705	petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose
  9706	body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,
  9707	some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the
  9708	Antarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of
  9709	the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a
  9710	wick in.
  9711	
  9712	"A little more," said Conseil, "and they would be perfect lamps!  After
  9713	that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with
  9714	wicks!"
  9715	
  9716	About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs' nests, a
  9717	sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing.  Captain
  9718	Nemo had some hundreds hunted.  They uttered a cry like the braying of
  9719	an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white
  9720	beneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed
  9721	themselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape.  But the
  9722	fog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself.  Its
  9723	absence made me uneasy.  Without it no observations were possible.
  9724	How, then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole?  When I
  9725	rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently
  9726	watching the sky.  He seemed impatient and vexed.  But what was to be
  9727	done?  This rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did
  9728	the sea.  Noon arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an
  9729	instant.  We could not even tell its position behind the curtain of
  9730	fog; and soon the fog turned to snow.
  9731	
  9732	"Till to-morrow," said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the
  9733	Nautilus amid these atmospheric disturbances.
  9734	
  9735	The tempest of snow continued till the next day.  It was impossible to
  9736	remain on the platform.  From the saloon, where I was taking notes of
  9737	incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I
  9738	could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst
  9739	of this violent storm.  The Nautilus did not remain motionless, but
  9740	skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the
  9741	half-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon.  The
  9742	next day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased.  The cold was a
  9743	little greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero.  The fog
  9744	was rising, and I hoped that that day our observations might be taken.
  9745	Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself
  9746	to land.  The soil was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere
  9747	were traces of lava, scoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had
  9748	vomited them I could not see.  Here, as lower down, this continent was
  9749	alive with myriads of birds.  But their rule was now divided with large
  9750	troops of sea-mammals, looking at us with their soft eyes.  There were
  9751	several kinds of seals, some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of
  9752	ice, many going in and out of the sea.  They did not flee at our
  9753	approach, never having had anything to do with man; and I reckoned that
  9754	there were provisions there for hundreds of vessels.
  9755	
  9756	"Sir," said Conseil, "will you tell me the names of these creatures?"
  9757	
  9758	"They are seals and morses."
  9759	
  9760	It was now eight in the morning.  Four hours remained to us before the
  9761	sun could be observed with advantage.  I directed our steps towards a
  9762	vast bay cut in the steep granite shore.  There, I can aver that earth
  9763	and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,
  9764	and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd
  9765	who watched these immense flocks of Neptune.  There were more seals
  9766	than anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the
  9767	father watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones,
  9768	some already strong enough to go a few steps.  When they wished to
  9769	change their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of
  9770	their bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin,
  9771	which, as with the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm.  I
  9772	should say that, in the water, which is their element--the spine of
  9773	these creatures is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed
  9774	feet--they swim admirably.  In resting on the earth they take the most
  9775	graceful attitudes.  Thus the ancients, observing their soft and
  9776	expressive looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look
  9777	a woman can give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming
  9778	positions, and the poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the
  9779	male into a triton and the female into a mermaid.  I made Conseil
  9780	notice the considerable development of the lobes of the brain in these
  9781	interesting cetaceans.  No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of
  9782	brain matter; they are also capable of receiving a certain amount of
  9783	education, are easily domesticated, and I think, with other
  9784	naturalists, that if properly taught they would be of great service as
  9785	fishing-dogs.  The greater part of them slept on the rocks or on the
  9786	sand.  Amongst these seals, properly so called, which have no external
  9787	ears (in which they differ from the otter, whose ears are prominent), I
  9788	noticed several varieties of seals about three yards long, with a white
  9789	coat, bulldog heads, armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at
  9790	the top and four at the bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape
  9791	of a fleur-de-lis. Amongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal,
  9792	with short, flexible trunks.  The giants of this species measured
  9793	twenty feet round and ten yards and a half in length; but they did not
  9794	move as we approached.
  9795	
  9796	"These creatures are not dangerous?" asked Conseil.
  9797	
  9798	"No; not unless you attack them.  When they have to defend their young
  9799	their rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the
  9800	fishing-boats to pieces."
  9801	
  9802	"They are quite right," said Conseil.
  9803	
  9804	"I do not say they are not."
  9805	
  9806	Two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters
  9807	the bay from the southerly winds.  Beyond it we heard loud bellowings
  9808	such as a troop of ruminants would produce.
  9809	
  9810	"Good!" said Conseil; "a concert of bulls!"
  9811	
  9812	"No; a concert of morses."
  9813	
  9814	"They are fighting!"
  9815	
  9816	"They are either fighting or playing."
  9817	
  9818	We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and
  9819	over stones which the ice made slippery.  More than once I rolled over
  9820	at the expense of my loins.  Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did
  9821	not stumble, and helped me up, saying:
  9822	
  9823	"If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would
  9824	preserve your equilibrium better."
  9825	
  9826	Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain
  9827	covered with morses.  They were playing amongst themselves, and what we
  9828	heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.
  9829	
  9830	As I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for
  9831	they did not move.  Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish
  9832	tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant.  Some of them
  9833	were four yards and a quarter long.  Quieter and less timid than their
  9834	cousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round
  9835	the outskirts of their encampment.  After examining this city of
  9836	morses, I began to think of returning.  It was eleven o'clock, and, if
  9837	Captain Nemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished
  9838	to be present at the operation.  We followed a narrow pathway running
  9839	along the summit of the steep shore.  At half-past eleven we had
  9840	reached the place where we landed.  The boat had run aground, bringing
  9841	the Captain.  I saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments
  9842	near him, his eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun
  9843	was then describing a lengthened curve.  I took my place beside him,
  9844	and waited without speaking.  Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did
  9845	not appear.  It was a fatality.  Observations were still wanting.  If
  9846	not accomplished to-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any.  We
  9847	were indeed exactly at the 20th of March.  To-morrow, the 21st, would
  9848	be the equinox; the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six
  9849	months, and with its disappearance the long polar night would begin.
  9850	Since the September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon,
  9851	rising by lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December.  At this
  9852	period, the summer solstice of the northern regions, it had begun to
  9853	descend; and to-morrow was to shed its last rays upon them.  I
  9854	communicated my fears and observations to Captain Nemo.
  9855	
  9856	"You are right, M. Aronnax," said he; "if to-morrow I cannot take the
  9857	altitude of the sun, I shall not be able to do it for six months.  But
  9858	precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of
  9859	March, my bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see the
  9860	sun."
  9861	
  9862	"Why, Captain?"
  9863	
  9864	"Because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it
  9865	is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon, and grave
  9866	errors may be made with instruments."
  9867	
  9868	"What will you do then?"
  9869	
  9870	"I shall only use my chronometer," replied Captain Nemo.  "If
  9871	to-morrow, the 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for
  9872	refraction, is exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I
  9873	am at the South Pole."
  9874	
  9875	"Just so," said I. "But this statement is not mathematically correct,
  9876	because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon."
  9877	
  9878	"Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do
  9879	not want more.  Till to-morrow, then!"
  9880	
  9881	Captain Nemo returned on board.  Conseil and I remained to survey the
  9882	shore, observing and studying until five o'clock. Then I went to bed,
  9883	not, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the
  9884	radiant orb.  The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning,
  9885	I mounted the platform.  I found Captain Nemo there.
  9886	
  9887	"The weather is lightening a little," said he.  "I have some hope.
  9888	After breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation."
  9889	
  9890	That point settled, I sought Ned Land.  I wanted to take him with me.
  9891	But the obstinate Canadian refused, and I saw that his taciturnity and
  9892	his bad humour grew day by day.  After all, I was not sorry for his
  9893	obstinacy under the circumstances.  Indeed, there were too many seals
  9894	on shore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting
  9895	fisherman's way.  Breakfast over, we went on shore.  The Nautilus had
  9896	gone some miles further up in the night.  It was a whole league from
  9897	the coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards
  9898	high.  The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the
  9899	instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a
  9900	barometer.  While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the
  9901	three kinds peculiar to the southern seas; the whale, or the English
  9902	"right whale," which has no dorsal fin; the "humpback," with reeved
  9903	chest and large, whitish fins, which, in spite of its name, do not form
  9904	wings; and the fin-back, of a yellowish brown, the liveliest of all the
  9905	cetacea.  This powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws
  9906	to a great height columns of air and vapour, which look like whirlwinds
  9907	of smoke.  These different mammals were disporting themselves in troops
  9908	in the quiet waters; and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic
  9909	Pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by
  9910	the hunters.  I also noticed large medusae floating between the reeds.
  9911	
  9912	At nine we landed; the sky was brightening, the clouds were flying to
  9913	the south, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the
  9914	waters.  Captain Nemo went towards the peak, which he doubtless meant
  9915	to be his observatory.  It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and
  9916	the pumice-stones, in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous
  9917	smell from the smoking cracks.  For a man unaccustomed to walk on land,
  9918	the Captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility I never saw
  9919	equalled and which a hunter would have envied.  We were two hours
  9920	getting to the summit of this peak, which was half porphyry and half
  9921	basalt.  From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, towards the
  9922	north, distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky.  At our feet
  9923	lay fields of dazzling whiteness.  Over our heads a pale azure, free
  9924	from fog.  To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire,
  9925	already horned by the cutting of the horizon.  From the bosom of the
  9926	water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds.  In the distance lay the
  9927	Nautilus like a cetacean asleep on the water.  Behind us, to the south
  9928	and east, an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, the
  9929	limits of which were not visible.  On arriving at the summit Captain
  9930	Nemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer, for he would have
  9931	to consider that in taking his observations.  At a quarter to twelve
  9932	the sun, then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc
  9933	shedding its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which
  9934	never man had yet ploughed.  Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular
  9935	glass which, by means of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched
  9936	the orb sinking below the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened
  9937	diagonal.  I held the chronometer.  My heart beat fast.  If the
  9938	disappearance of the half-disc of the sun coincided with twelve o'clock
  9939	on the chronometer, we were at the pole itself.
  9940	
  9941	"Twelve!"  I exclaimed.
  9942	
  9943	"The South Pole!" replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing me
  9944	the glass, which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the
  9945	horizon.
  9946	
  9947	I looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the shadows mounting
  9948	by degrees up its slopes.  At that moment Captain Nemo, resting with
  9949	his hand on my shoulder, said:
  9950	
  9951	"I, Captain Nemo, on this 21st day of March, 1868, have reached the
  9952	South Pole on the ninetieth degree; and I take possession of this part
  9953	of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents."
  9954	
  9955	"In whose name, Captain?"
  9956	
  9957	"In my own, sir!"
  9958	
  9959	Saying which, Captain Nemo unfurled a black banner, bearing an "N" in
  9960	gold quartered on its bunting.  Then, turning towards the orb of day,
  9961	whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea, he exclaimed:
  9962	
  9963	"Adieu, sun!  Disappear, thou radiant orb! rest beneath this open sea,
  9964	and let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains!"
  9965	
  9966	
  9967	
  9968	CHAPTER XV
  9969	
  9970	ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT?
  9971	
  9972	The next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations
  9973	for departure were begun.  The last gleams of twilight were melting
  9974	into night.  The cold was great, the constellations shone with
  9975	wonderful intensity.  In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern
  9976	Cross--the polar bear of Antarctic regions.  The thermometer showed 120
  9977	below zero, and when the wind freshened it was most biting.  Flakes of
  9978	ice increased on the open water.  The sea seemed everywhere alike.
  9979	Numerous blackish patches spread on the surface, showing the formation
  9980	of fresh ice.  Evidently the southern basin, frozen during the six
  9981	winter months, was absolutely inaccessible.  What became of the whales
  9982	in that time?  Doubtless they went beneath the icebergs, seeking more
  9983	practicable seas.  As to the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a
  9984	hard climate, they remained on these icy shores.  These creatures have
  9985	the instinct to break holes in the ice-field and to keep them open.  To
  9986	these holes they come for breath; when the birds, driven away by the
  9987	cold, have emigrated to the north, these sea mammals remain sole
  9988	masters of the polar continent.  But the reservoirs were filling with
  9989	water, and the Nautilus was slowly descending.  At 1,000 feet deep it
  9990	stopped; its screw beat the waves, and it advanced straight towards the
  9991	north at a speed of fifteen miles an hour.  Towards night it was
  9992	already floating under the immense body of the iceberg.  At three in
  9993	the morning I was awakened by a violent shock.  I sat up in my bed and
  9994	listened in the darkness, when I was thrown into the middle of the
  9995	room.  The Nautilus, after having struck, had rebounded violently.  I
  9996	groped along the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which
  9997	was lit by the luminous ceiling.  The furniture was upset.  Fortunately
  9998	the windows were firmly set, and had held fast.  The pictures on the
  9999	starboard side, from being no longer vertical, were clinging to the
 10000	paper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from
 10001	the wall.  The Nautilus was lying on its starboard side perfectly
 10002	motionless.  I heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain
 10003	Nemo did not appear.  As I was leaving the saloon, Ned Land and Conseil
 10004	entered.
 10005	
 10006	"What is the matter?" said I, at once.
 10007	
 10008	"I came to ask you, sir," replied Conseil.
 10009	
 10010	"Confound it!" exclaimed the Canadian, "I know well enough!  The
 10011	Nautilus has struck; and, judging by the way she lies, I do not think
 10012	she will right herself as she did the first time in Torres Straits."
 10013	
 10014	"But," I asked, "has she at least come to the surface of the sea?"
 10015	
 10016	"We do not know," said Conseil.
 10017	
 10018	"It is easy to decide," I answered.  I consulted the manometer.  To my
 10019	great surprise, it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms.  "What does
 10020	that mean?"  I exclaimed.
 10021	
 10022	"We must ask Captain Nemo," said Conseil.
 10023	
 10024	"But where shall we find him?" said Ned Land.
 10025	
 10026	"Follow me," said I, to my companions.
 10027	
 10028	We left the saloon.  There was no one in the library.  At the centre
 10029	staircase, by the berths of the ship's crew, there was no one.  I
 10030	thought that Captain Nemo must be in the pilot's cage.  It was best to
 10031	wait.  We all returned to the saloon.  For twenty minutes we remained
 10032	thus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board
 10033	the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered.  He seemed not to see us; his
 10034	face, generally so impassive, showed signs of uneasiness.  He watched
 10035	the compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to the
 10036	planisphere, placed his finger on a spot representing the southern
 10037	seas.  I would not interrupt him; but, some minutes later, when he
 10038	turned towards me, I said, using one of his own expressions in the
 10039	Torres Straits:
 10040	
 10041	"An incident, Captain?"
 10042	
 10043	"No, sir; an accident this time."
 10044	
 10045	"Serious?"
 10046	
 10047	"Perhaps."
 10048	
 10049	"Is the danger immediate?"
 10050	
 10051	"No."
 10052	
 10053	"The Nautilus has stranded?"
 10054	
 10055	"Yes."
 10056	
 10057	"And this has happened--how?"
 10058	
 10059	"From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man.  Not a
 10060	mistake has been made in the working.  But we cannot prevent
 10061	equilibrium from producing its effects.  We may brave human laws, but
 10062	we cannot resist natural ones."
 10063	
 10064	Captain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this
 10065	philosophical reflection.  On the whole, his answer helped me little.
 10066	
 10067	"May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?"
 10068	
 10069	"An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has turned over," he
 10070	replied.  "When icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water
 10071	or reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises, and the whole thing
 10072	turns over.  This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it
 10073	fell, struck the Nautilus, then, gliding under its hull, raised it with
 10074	irresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, where
 10075	it is lying on its side."
 10076	
 10077	"But can we not get the Nautilus off by emptying its reservoirs, that
 10078	it might regain its equilibrium?"
 10079	
 10080	"That, sir, is being done at this moment.  You can hear the pump
 10081	working.  Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the
 10082	Nautilus is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,
 10083	until some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot be
 10084	altered."
 10085	
 10086	Indeed, the Nautilus still held the same position to starboard;
 10087	doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped.  But at this
 10088	moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two
 10089	glassy surfaces?  I reflected on all the consequences of our position.
 10090	Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer.  Since the fall of
 10091	the iceberg, the Nautilus had risen about a hundred and fifty feet, but
 10092	it still made the same angle with the perpendicular.  Suddenly a slight
 10093	movement was felt in the hold.  Evidently it was righting a little.
 10094	Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their normal
 10095	position.  The partitions were nearing the upright.  No one spoke.
 10096	With beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening.  The boards
 10097	became horizontal under our feet.  Ten minutes passed.
 10098	
 10099	"At last we have righted!"  I exclaimed.
 10100	
 10101	"Yes," said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon.
 10102	
 10103	"But are we floating?"  I asked.
 10104	
 10105	"Certainly," he replied; "since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when
 10106	empty, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea."
 10107	
 10108	We were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either
 10109	side of the Nautilus, rose a dazzling wall of ice.  Above and beneath
 10110	the same wall.  Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg
 10111	stretched over us like an immense ceiling.  Beneath, because the
 10112	overturned block, having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on
 10113	the lateral walls, which kept it in that position.  The Nautilus was
 10114	really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in
 10115	breadth, filled with quiet water.  It was easy to get out of it by
 10116	going either forward or backward, and then make a free passage under
 10117	the iceberg, some hundreds of yards deeper.  The luminous ceiling had
 10118	been extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense
 10119	light.  It was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent
 10120	violently back to the sheets of the lantern.  I cannot describe the
 10121	effect of the voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut;
 10122	upon every angle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different
 10123	light, according to the nature of the veins running through the ice; a
 10124	dazzling mine of gems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays
 10125	crossing with the green of the emerald.  Here and there were opal
 10126	shades of wonderful softness, running through bright spots like
 10127	diamonds of fire, the brilliancy of which the eye could not bear.  The
 10128	power of the lantern seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp
 10129	through the lenticular plates of a first-class lighthouse.
 10130	
 10131	"How beautiful! how beautiful!" cried Conseil.
 10132	
 10133	"Yes," I said, "it is a wonderful sight.  Is it not, Ned?"
 10134	
 10135	"Yes, confound it!  Yes," answered Ned Land, "it is superb!  I am mad
 10136	at being obliged to admit it.  No one has ever seen anything like it;
 10137	but the sight may cost us dear.  And, if I must say all, I think we are
 10138	seeing here things which God never intended man to see."
 10139	
 10140	Ned was right, it was too beautiful.  Suddenly a cry from Conseil made
 10141	me turn.
 10142	
 10143	"What is it?"  I asked.
 10144	
 10145	"Shut your eyes, sir!  Do not look, sir!"  Saying which, Conseil
 10146	clapped his hands over his eyes.
 10147	
 10148	"But what is the matter, my boy?"
 10149	
 10150	"I am dazzled, blinded."
 10151	
 10152	My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand
 10153	the fire which seemed to devour them.  I understood what had happened.
 10154	The Nautilus had put on full speed.  All the quiet lustre of the
 10155	ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning.  The fire from
 10156	these myriads of diamonds was blinding.  It required some time to calm
 10157	our troubled looks.  At last the hands were taken down.
 10158	
 10159	"Faith, I should never have believed it," said Conseil.
 10160	
 10161	It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at
 10162	the bows of the Nautilus.  I knew that its spur had struck a block of
 10163	ice.  It must have been a false manoeuvre, for this submarine tunnel,
 10164	obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation.  I thought that
 10165	Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles
 10166	or else follow the windings of the tunnel.  In any case, the road
 10167	before us could not be entirely blocked.  But, contrary to my
 10168	expectations, the Nautilus took a decided retrograde motion.
 10169	
 10170	"We are going backwards?" said Conseil.
 10171	
 10172	"Yes," I replied.  "This end of the tunnel can have no egress."
 10173	
 10174	"And then?"
 10175	
 10176	"Then," said I, "the working is easy.  We must go back again, and go
 10177	out at the southern opening.  That is all."
 10178	
 10179	In speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.
 10180	But the retrograde motion of the Nautilus was increasing; and,
 10181	reversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.
 10182	
 10183	"It will be a hindrance," said Ned.
 10184	
 10185	"What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at
 10186	last?"
 10187	
 10188	"Yes," repeated Ned Land, "provided we do get out at last!"
 10189	
 10190	For a short time I walked from the saloon to the library.  My
 10191	companions were silent.  I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a
 10192	book, which my eyes overran mechanically.  A quarter of an hour after,
 10193	Conseil, approaching me, said, "Is what you are reading very
 10194	interesting, sir?"
 10195	
 10196	"Very interesting!"  I replied.
 10197	
 10198	"I should think so, sir.  It is your own book you are reading."
 10199	
 10200	"My book?"
 10201	
 10202	And indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine
 10203	Depths.  I did not even dream of it.  I closed the book and returned to
 10204	my walk.  Ned and Conseil rose to go.
 10205	
 10206	"Stay here, my friends," said I, detaining them.  "Let us remain
 10207	together until we are out of this block."
 10208	
 10209	"As you please, sir," Conseil replied.
 10210	
 10211	Some hours passed.  I often looked at the instruments hanging from the
 10212	partition.  The manometer showed that the Nautilus kept at a constant
 10213	depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to
 10214	south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in
 10215	such a cramped space, was very great.  But Captain Nemo knew that he
 10216	could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us.  At
 10217	twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time
 10218	from behind.  I turned pale.  My companions were close by my side.  I
 10219	seized Conseil's hand.  Our looks expressed our feelings better than
 10220	words.  At this moment the Captain entered the saloon.  I went up to
 10221	him.
 10222	
 10223	"Our course is barred southward?"  I asked.
 10224	
 10225	"Yes, sir.  The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet."
 10226	
 10227	"We are blocked up then?"
 10228	
 10229	"Yes."
 10230	
 10231	
 10232	
 10233	CHAPTER XVI
 10234	
 10235	WANT OF AIR
 10236	
 10237	Thus around the Nautilus, above and below, was an impenetrable wall of
 10238	ice.  We were prisoners to the iceberg.  I watched the Captain.  His
 10239	countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.
 10240	
 10241	"Gentlemen," he said calmly, "there are two ways of dying in the
 10242	circumstances in which we are placed."  (This puzzling person had the
 10243	air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) "The first is
 10244	to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation.  I do not speak of
 10245	the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the
 10246	Nautilus will certainly last longer than we shall.  Let us, then,
 10247	calculate our chances."
 10248	
 10249	"As to suffocation, Captain," I replied, "that is not to be feared,
 10250	because our reservoirs are full."
 10251	
 10252	"Just so; but they will only yield two days' supply of air.  Now, for
 10253	thirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the
 10254	heavy atmosphere of the Nautilus requires renewal.  In forty-eight
 10255	hours our reserve will be exhausted."
 10256	
 10257	"Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?"
 10258	
 10259	"We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us."
 10260	
 10261	"On which side?"
 10262	
 10263	"Sound will tell us.  I am going to run the Nautilus aground on the
 10264	lower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is
 10265	least thick."
 10266	
 10267	Captain Nemo went out.  Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the
 10268	water was entering the reservoirs.  The Nautilus sank slowly, and
 10269	rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower
 10270	bank was immersed.
 10271	
 10272	"My friends," I said, "our situation is serious, but I rely on your
 10273	courage and energy."
 10274	
 10275	"Sir," replied the Canadian, "I am ready to do anything for the general
 10276	safety."
 10277	
 10278	"Good!  Ned," and I held out my hand to the Canadian.
 10279	
 10280	"I will add," he continued, "that, being as handy with the pickaxe as
 10281	with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my
 10282	services."
 10283	
 10284	"He will not refuse your help.  Come, Ned!"
 10285	
 10286	I led him to the room where the crew of the Nautilus were putting on
 10287	their cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned's proposal, which he
 10288	accepted.  The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon
 10289	as his companions.  When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the
 10290	drawing-room, where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near
 10291	Conseil, I examined the ambient beds that supported the Nautilus.  Some
 10292	instants after, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice,
 10293	and among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature.  Captain Nemo was
 10294	with them.  Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings,
 10295	to be sure of working in the right direction.  Long sounding lines were
 10296	sunk in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped
 10297	by the thick wall.  It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like
 10298	surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in
 10299	height.  Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface.  There ten yards
 10300	of wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the
 10301	ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in
 10302	extent to the waterline of the Nautilus.  There were about 6,000 cubic
 10303	yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the
 10304	ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with
 10305	indefatigable energy.  Instead of digging round the Nautilus which
 10306	would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense
 10307	trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to
 10308	work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its
 10309	circumference.  Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter
 10310	vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass.  By a curious
 10311	effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so
 10312	to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at
 10313	the top in proportion as it diminished at the base.  But that mattered
 10314	little, so long as the lower part grew thinner.  After two hours' hard
 10315	work, Ned Land came in exhausted.  He and his comrades were replaced by
 10316	new workers, whom Conseil and I joined.  The second lieutenant of the
 10317	Nautilus superintended us.  The water seemed singularly cold, but I
 10318	soon got warm handling the pickaxe.  My movements were free enough,
 10319	although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.  When I
 10320	re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I
 10321	found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the
 10322	Rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the Nautilus,
 10323	already charged with carbonic acid.  The air had not been renewed for
 10324	forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably
 10325	enfeebled.  However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised
 10326	a block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about
 10327	600 cubic yards!  Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish
 10328	this much it would take five nights and four days to bring this
 10329	enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.  Five nights and four days!
 10330	And we have only air enough for two days in the reservoirs!  "Without
 10331	taking into account," said Ned, "that, even if we get out of this
 10332	infernal prison, we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut
 10333	out from all possible communication with the atmosphere." True enough!
 10334	Who could then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our
 10335	deliverance?  We might be suffocated before the Nautilus could regain
 10336	the surface of the waves?  Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb,
 10337	with all those it enclosed?  The situation was terrible.  But everyone
 10338	had looked the danger in the face, and each was determined to do his
 10339	duty to the last.
 10340	
 10341	As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried
 10342	away, and still further sank the immense hollow.  But in the morning
 10343	when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a
 10344	temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the
 10345	side walls were gradually closing in.  The beds of water farthest from
 10346	the trench, that were not warmed by the men's work, showed a tendency
 10347	to solidification.  In presence of this new and imminent danger, what
 10348	would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the
 10349	solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions
 10350	of the Nautilus like glass?
 10351	
 10352	I did not tell my companions of this new danger.  What was the good of
 10353	damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape?  But
 10354	when I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave
 10355	complication.
 10356	
 10357	"I know it," he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most
 10358	terrible apprehensions.  "It is one danger more; but I see no way of
 10359	escaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than
 10360	solidification.  We must be beforehand with it, that is all."
 10361	
 10362	On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously.  The work
 10363	kept me up.  Besides, to work was to quit the Nautilus, and breathe
 10364	directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our
 10365	apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.
 10366	Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper.  When I returned on
 10367	board, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air
 10368	was filled--ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this
 10369	deleterious gas.  We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a
 10370	considerable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it
 10371	would restore the vivifying fluid.  I had thought well over it; but of
 10372	what good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration
 10373	had invaded every part of the vessel?  To absorb it, it was necessary
 10374	to fill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly.
 10375	Now this substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it.
 10376	On that evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,
 10377	and let some pure air into the interior of the Nautilus; without this
 10378	precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation.  The next
 10379	day, March 26th, I resumed my miner's work in beginning the fifth yard.
 10380	The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.
 10381	It was evident that they would meet before the Nautilus was able to
 10382	disengage itself.  Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly
 10383	fell from my hands.  What was the good of digging if I must be
 10384	suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?--a
 10385	punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have
 10386	invented!  Just then Captain Nemo passed near me.  I touched his hand
 10387	and showed him the walls of our prison.  The wall to port had advanced
 10388	to at least four yards from the hull of the Nautilus.  The Captain
 10389	understood me, and signed me to follow him.  We went on board.  I took
 10390	off my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.
 10391	
 10392	"M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be
 10393	sealed up in this solidified water as in cement."
 10394	
 10395	"Yes; but what is to be done?"
 10396	
 10397	"Ah! if my Nautilus were strong enough to bear this pressure without
 10398	being crushed!"
 10399	
 10400	"Well?"  I asked, not catching the Captain's idea.
 10401	
 10402	"Do you not understand," he replied, "that this congelation of water
 10403	will help us?  Do you not see that by its solidification, it would
 10404	burst through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes,
 10405	it bursts the hardest stones?  Do you not perceive that it would be an
 10406	agent of safety instead of destruction?"
 10407	
 10408	"Yes, Captain, perhaps.  But, whatever resistance to crushing the
 10409	Nautilus possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and
 10410	would be flattened like an iron plate."
 10411	
 10412	"I know it, sir.  Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature,
 10413	but on our own exertions.  We must stop this solidification.  Not only
 10414	will the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of
 10415	water before or behind the Nautilus.  The congelation gains on us on
 10416	all sides."
 10417	
 10418	"How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on
 10419	board?"
 10420	
 10421	The Captain looked in my face.  "After to-morrow they will be empty!"
 10422	
 10423	A cold sweat came over me.  However, ought I to have been astonished at
 10424	the answer?  On March 22, the Nautilus was in the open polar seas.  We
 10425	were at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board.
 10426	And what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers.
 10427	Even now, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an
 10428	involuntary terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air.
 10429	Meanwhile, Captain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had
 10430	struck him; but he seemed to reject it.  At last, these words escaped
 10431	his lips:
 10432	
 10433	"Boiling water!" he muttered.
 10434	
 10435	"Boiling water?"  I cried.
 10436	
 10437	"Yes, sir.  We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.
 10438	Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,
 10439	raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?"
 10440	
 10441	"Let us try it," I said resolutely.
 10442	
 10443	"Let us try it, Professor."
 10444	
 10445	The thermometer then stood at 7° outside.  Captain Nemo took me to
 10446	the galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished
 10447	the drinkable water by evaporation.  They filled these with water, and
 10448	all the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms
 10449	bathed in the liquid.  In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It
 10450	was directed towards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in
 10451	proportion.  The heat developed by the troughs was such that cold
 10452	water, drawn up from the sea after only having gone through the
 10453	machines, came boiling into the body of the pump.  The injection was
 10454	begun, and three hours after the thermometer marked 6° below zero
 10455	outside.  One degree was gained.  Two hours later the thermometer only
 10456	marked 4°.
 10457	
 10458	"We shall succeed," I said to the Captain, after having anxiously
 10459	watched the result of the operation.
 10460	
 10461	"I think," he answered, "that we shall not be crushed.  We have no more
 10462	suffocation to fear."
 10463	
 10464	During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below
 10465	zero.  The injections could not carry it to a higher point.  But, as
 10466	the congelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at
 10467	least reassured against the dangers of solidification.
 10468	
 10469	The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve
 10470	feet only remaining to be cleared away.  There was yet forty-eight
 10471	hours' work.  The air could not be renewed in the interior of the
 10472	Nautilus.  And this day would make it worse.  An intolerable weight
 10473	oppressed me.  Towards three o'clock in the evening this feeling rose
 10474	to a violent degree.  Yawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs panted as
 10475	they inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more.
 10476	A moral torpor took hold of me.  I was powerless, almost unconscious.
 10477	My brave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in
 10478	the same manner, never left me.  He took my hand and encouraged me, and
 10479	I heard him murmur, "Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave
 10480	more air for my master!"
 10481	
 10482	Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus.  If our situation to
 10483	all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would
 10484	we put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn!  Pickaxes sounded on
 10485	the frozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands.
 10486	But what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter?  Vital air
 10487	came to the lungs!  We breathed! we breathed!
 10488	
 10489	All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed
 10490	time.  His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting
 10491	companions the apparatus that supplied him with life.  Captain Nemo set
 10492	the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline.  When the
 10493	time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the
 10494	vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.
 10495	
 10496	On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.
 10497	Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface.  Two yards only
 10498	separated us from the open sea.  But the reservoirs were nearly emptied
 10499	of air.  The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not
 10500	a particle for the Nautilus.  When I went back on board, I was half
 10501	suffocated.  What a night!  I know not how to describe it.  The next
 10502	day my breathing was oppressed.  Dizziness accompanied the pain in my
 10503	head and made me like a drunken man.  My companions showed the same
 10504	symptoms.  Some of the crew had rattling in the throat.
 10505	
 10506	On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the
 10507	pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still
 10508	separated us from the liquid sheet.  This man's coolness and energy
 10509	never forsook him.  He subdued his physical pains by moral force.
 10510	
 10511	By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the
 10512	ice-bed by a change of specific gravity.  When it floated they towed it
 10513	so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the
 10514	water-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and
 10515	shut himself up in the hole.
 10516	
 10517	Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of
 10518	communication was shut.  The Nautilus then rested on the bed of ice,
 10519	which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had
 10520	perforated in a thousand places.  The taps of the reservoirs were then
 10521	opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the
 10522	weight of the Nautilus to 1,800 tons.  We waited, we listened,
 10523	forgetting our sufferings in hope.  Our safety depended on this last
 10524	chance.  Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the
 10525	humming sound under the hull of the Nautilus.  The ice cracked with a
 10526	singular noise, like tearing paper, and the Nautilus sank.
 10527	
 10528	"We are off!" murmured Conseil in my ear.
 10529	
 10530	I could not answer him.  I seized his hand, and pressed it
 10531	convulsively.  All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge,
 10532	the Nautilus sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it
 10533	fell as if it was in a vacuum.  Then all the electric force was put on
 10534	the pumps, that soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs.
 10535	After some minutes, our fall was stopped.  Soon, too, the manometer
 10536	indicated an ascending movement.  The screw, going at full speed, made
 10537	the iron hull tremble to its very bolts and drew us towards the north.
 10538	But if this floating under the iceberg is to last another day before we
 10539	reach the open sea, I shall be dead first.
 10540	
 10541	Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face
 10542	was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended.  I neither saw nor
 10543	heard.  All notion of time had gone from my mind.  My muscles could not
 10544	contract.  I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was
 10545	conscious of the agony that was coming over me.  I felt as if I was
 10546	going to die.  Suddenly I came to.  Some breaths of air penetrated my
 10547	lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?  Were we free of the
 10548	iceberg?  No!  Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing
 10549	themselves to save me.  Some particles of air still remained at the
 10550	bottom of one apparatus.  Instead of using it, they had kept it for me,
 10551	and, while they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop.
 10552	I wanted to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some
 10553	moments I breathed freely.  I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the
 10554	morning.  It ought to be the 28th of March.  The Nautilus went at a
 10555	frightful pace, forty miles an hour.  It literally tore through the
 10556	water.  Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he succumbed?  Were his companions
 10557	dead with him?  At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not
 10558	more than twenty feet from the surface.  A mere plate of ice separated
 10559	us from the atmosphere.  Could we not break it?  Perhaps.  In any case
 10560	the Nautilus was going to attempt it.  I felt that it was in an oblique
 10561	position, lowering the stern, and raising the bows.  The introduction
 10562	of water had been the means of disturbing its equilibrium.  Then,
 10563	impelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath
 10564	like a formidable battering-ram.  It broke it by backing and then
 10565	rushing forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at
 10566	last, dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that
 10567	crushed beneath its weight.  The panel was opened--one might say torn
 10568	off--and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the Nautilus.
 10569	
 10570	
 10571	
 10572	CHAPTER XVII
 10573	
 10574	FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON
 10575	
 10576	How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had
 10577	carried me there.  But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air.  My
 10578	two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles.  The other
 10579	unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with
 10580	impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them.  We, on
 10581	the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air
 10582	freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that
 10583	filled us with this keen enjoyment.
 10584	
 10585	"Ah!" said Conseil, "how delightful this oxygen is!  Master need not
 10586	fear to breathe it.  There is enough for everybody."
 10587	
 10588	Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten
 10589	a shark.  Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I
 10590	saw we were alone on the platform.  The foreign seamen in the Nautilus
 10591	were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of
 10592	them had come to drink in the open air.
 10593	
 10594	The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my
 10595	two companions.  Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last
 10596	hours of this long agony.  All my gratitude could not repay such
 10597	devotion.
 10598	
 10599	"My friends," said I, "we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am
 10600	under infinite obligations to you."
 10601	
 10602	"Which I shall take advantage of," exclaimed the Canadian.
 10603	
 10604	"What do you mean?" said Conseil.
 10605	
 10606	"I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal
 10607	Nautilus."
 10608	
 10609	"Well," said Conseil, "after all this, are we going right?"
 10610	
 10611	"Yes," I replied, "for we are going the way of the sun, and here the
 10612	sun is in the north."
 10613	
 10614	"No doubt," said Ned Land; "but it remains to be seen whether he will
 10615	bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into
 10616	frequented or deserted seas."
 10617	
 10618	I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would
 10619	rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and
 10620	America at the same time.  He would thus complete the tour round the
 10621	submarine world, and return to those waters in which the Nautilus could
 10622	sail freely.  We ought, before long, to settle this important point.
 10623	The Nautilus went at a rapid pace.  The polar circle was soon passed,
 10624	and the course shaped for Cape Horn.  We were off the American point,
 10625	March 31st, at seven o'clock in the evening.  Then all our past
 10626	sufferings were forgotten.  The remembrance of that imprisonment in the
 10627	ice was effaced from our minds.  We only thought of the future.
 10628	Captain Nemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the
 10629	platform.  The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by
 10630	the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the Nautilus.  Now, on
 10631	that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we were
 10632	going back to the North by the Atlantic.  The next day, April 1st, when
 10633	the Nautilus ascended to the surface some minutes before noon, we
 10634	sighted land to the west.  It was Terra del Fuego, which the first
 10635	navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from
 10636	the natives' huts.  The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance
 10637	rose high mountains.  I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount
 10638	Sarmiento, that rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a
 10639	very pointed summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a
 10640	sign of fine or of wet weather.  At this moment the peak was clearly
 10641	defined against the sky.  The Nautilus, diving again under the water,
 10642	approached the coast, which was only some few miles off.  From the
 10643	glass windows in the drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic
 10644	fuci and varech, of which the open polar sea contains so many
 10645	specimens, with their sharp polished filaments; they measured about 300
 10646	yards in length--real cables, thicker than one's thumb; and, having
 10647	great tenacity, they are often used as ropes for vessels.  Another weed
 10648	known as velp, with leaves four feet long, buried in the coral
 10649	concretions, hung at the bottom.  It served as nest and food for
 10650	myriads of crustacea and molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish.  There seals
 10651	and otters had splendid repasts, eating the flesh of fish with
 10652	sea-vegetables, according to the English fashion.  Over this fertile
 10653	and luxuriant ground the Nautilus passed with great rapidity.  Towards
 10654	evening it approached the Falkland group, the rough summits of which I
 10655	recognised the following day.  The depth of the sea was moderate.  On
 10656	the shores our nets brought in beautiful specimens of sea weed, and
 10657	particularly a certain fucus, the roots of which were filled with the
 10658	best mussels in the world.  Geese and ducks fell by dozens on the
 10659	platform, and soon took their places in the pantry on board.
 10660	
 10661	When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the
 10662	horizon, the Nautilus sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards, and
 10663	followed the American coast.  Captain Nemo did not show himself.  Until
 10664	the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia, sometimes
 10665	under the ocean, sometimes at the surface.  The Nautilus passed beyond
 10666	the large estuary formed by the Uraguay.  Its direction was northwards,
 10667	and followed the long windings of the coast of South America.  We had
 10668	then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas of Japan.
 10669	About eleven o'clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn was crossed
 10670	on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio standing out to
 10671	sea.  Captain Nemo, to Ned Land's great displeasure, did not like the
 10672	neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we went at a giddy
 10673	speed.  Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind could follow us,
 10674	and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all observation.
 10675	
 10676	This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th
 10677	of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms
 10678	Cape San Roque.  But then the Nautilus swerved again, and sought the
 10679	lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and
 10680	Sierra Leone on the African coast.  This valley bifurcates to the
 10681	parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the mouth by the enormous
 10682	depression of 9,000 yards.  In this place, the geological basin of the
 10683	ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half
 10684	miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde
 10685	Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all
 10686	the sunk continent of the Atlantic.  The bottom of this immense valley
 10687	is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a
 10688	picturesque aspect.  I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that
 10689	were in the library of the Nautilus--charts evidently due to Captain
 10690	Nemo's hand, and made after his personal observations.  For two days
 10691	the desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined
 10692	planes.  The Nautilus was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which
 10693	carried it to all elevations.  But on the 11th of April it rose
 10694	suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast
 10695	estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens
 10696	the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.
 10697	
 10698	The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a
 10699	French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a
 10700	stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed
 10701	a single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he
 10702	spoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his
 10703	schemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that
 10704	must inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting
 10705	studies.  During the days of April 11th and 12th, the Nautilus did not
 10706	leave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul
 10707	of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by
 10708	the chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful
 10709	phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other
 10710	species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,
 10711	with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines,
 10712	speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.
 10713	As to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already
 10714	observed--turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines
 10715	intercrossed, with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh;
 10716	odd pteroceras, like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas,
 10717	argonauts, cuttle-fish (excellent eating), and certain species of
 10718	calmars that naturalists of antiquity have classed amongst the
 10719	flying-fish, and that serve principally for bait for cod-fishing. I had
 10720	now an opportunity of studying several species of fish on these shores.
 10721	Amongst the cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel,
 10722	fifteen inches long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back,
 10723	brown belly, silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye
 10724	encircled with gold--a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon
 10725	had drawn to the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters--tuberculated
 10726	streaks, with pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long
 10727	jagged sting; little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and
 10728	several rows of teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name
 10729	of pantouffles; vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a
 10730	yard long, to which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that
 10731	make them look like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near
 10732	the nostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some
 10733	species of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant
 10734	gold colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades
 10735	like a pigeon's throat.
 10736	
 10737	I end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very
 10738	exact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging
 10739	to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a
 10740	beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;
 10741	odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering
 10742	with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two
 10743	anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with
 10744	torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and
 10745	firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like
 10746	smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom
 10747	of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver
 10748	blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed
 10749	spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose
 10750	phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;
 10751	orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal
 10752	fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.
 10753	
 10754	Notwithstanding this "et cetera," I must not omit to mention fish that
 10755	Conseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had
 10756	hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,
 10757	formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white
 10758	underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled
 10759	with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on
 10760	the platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive
 10761	movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent
 10762	it into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to
 10763	it, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In
 10764	a moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body
 10765	paralysed, crying--
 10766	
 10767	"Oh! master, master! help me!"
 10768	
 10769	It was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly.  The
 10770	Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till he
 10771	became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish of
 10772	the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium
 10773	conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards' distance, so great
 10774	is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which
 10775	do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April
 10776	12th, the Nautilus approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the
 10777	Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were
 10778	manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian
 10779	order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from
 10780	eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen
 10781	hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had
 10782	assigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the
 10783	seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus
 10784	destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.
 10785	
 10786	"And do you know," I added, "what has been the result since men have
 10787	almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds
 10788	have poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,
 10789	that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are
 10790	multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly
 10791	developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are
 10792	to believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the
 10793	seas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,
 10794	medusae, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of
 10795	infection, since their waves would not possess 'these vast stomachs
 10796	that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.'"
 10797	
 10798	
 10799	
 10800	CHAPTER XVIII
 10801	
 10802	THE POULPS
 10803	
 10804	For several days the Nautilus kept off from the American coast.
 10805	Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of
 10806	the sea of the Antilles.  April 16th, we sighted Martinique and
 10807	Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles.  I saw their tall
 10808	peaks for an instant.  The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his
 10809	projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous
 10810	boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.
 10811	Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to
 10812	take possession of the boat without the Captain's knowledge.  But in
 10813	the open sea it could not be thought of.  The Canadian, Conseil, and I
 10814	had a long conversation on this subject.  For six months we had been
 10815	prisoners on board the Nautilus.  We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and,
 10816	as Ned Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end.  We
 10817	could hope nothing from the Captain of the Nautilus, but only from
 10818	ourselves.  Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more
 10819	retired, less sociable.  He seemed to shun me.  I met him rarely.
 10820	Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he
 10821	left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon.  What change had
 10822	come over him?  For what cause?  For my part, I did not wish to bury
 10823	with me my curious and novel studies.  I had now the power to write the
 10824	true book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see
 10825	daylight.  The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas.
 10826	There rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds.  It was
 10827	about eleven o'clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable
 10828	pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of
 10829	large seaweeds.
 10830	
 10831	"Well," I said, "these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not
 10832	be astonished to see some of these monsters."
 10833	
 10834	"What!" said Conseil; "cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod
 10835	class?"
 10836	
 10837	"No," I said, "poulps of huge dimensions."
 10838	
 10839	"I will never believe that such animals exist," said Ned.
 10840	
 10841	"Well," said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, "I
 10842	remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by
 10843	an octopus's arm."
 10844	
 10845	"You saw that?" said the Canadian.
 10846	
 10847	"Yes, Ned."
 10848	
 10849	"With your own eyes?"
 10850	
 10851	"With my own eyes."
 10852	
 10853	"Where, pray, might that be?"
 10854	
 10855	"At St. Malo," answered Conseil.
 10856	
 10857	"In the port?" said Ned, ironically.
 10858	
 10859	"No; in a church," replied Conseil.
 10860	
 10861	"In a church!" cried the Canadian.
 10862	
 10863	"Yes; friend Ned.  In a picture representing the poulp in question."
 10864	
 10865	"Good!" said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.
 10866	
 10867	"He is quite right," I said.  "I have heard of this picture; but the
 10868	subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think
 10869	of legends in the matter of natural history.  Besides, when it is a
 10870	question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild.  Not only is
 10871	it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain
 10872	Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an
 10873	island than an animal.  It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was
 10874	building an altar on an immense rock.  Mass finished, the rock began to
 10875	walk, and returned to the sea.  The rock was a poulp.  Another Bishop,
 10876	Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry
 10877	could manoeuvre.  Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters
 10878	whose mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through
 10879	the Straits of Gibraltar."
 10880	
 10881	"But how much is true of these stories?" asked Conseil.
 10882	
 10883	"Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth
 10884	to get to fable or legend.  Nevertheless, there must be some ground for
 10885	the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and
 10886	cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the
 10887	cetaceans.  Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five
 10888	cubits, or nine feet two inches.  Our fishermen frequently see some
 10889	that are more than four feet long.  Some skeletons of poulps are
 10890	preserved in the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two
 10891	yards in length.  Besides, according to the calculations of some
 10892	naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would have
 10893	tentacles twenty-seven feet long.  That would suffice to make a
 10894	formidable monster."
 10895	
 10896	"Do they fish for them in these days?" asked Ned.
 10897	
 10898	"If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least.  One of my
 10899	friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one
 10900	of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas.  But the
 10901	most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the
 10902	existence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861."
 10903	
 10904	"What is the fact?" asked Ned Land.
 10905	
 10906	"This is it.  In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in
 10907	the same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector
 10908	perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters.  Captain
 10909	Bouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,
 10910	without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft
 10911	flesh.  After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a
 10912	slip-knot round the body of the mollusc.  The noose slipped as far as
 10913	the tail fins and there stopped.  They tried then to haul it on board,
 10914	but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord
 10915	separated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he
 10916	disappeared under the water."
 10917	
 10918	"Indeed! is that a fact?"
 10919	
 10920	"An indisputable fact, my good Ned.  They proposed to name this poulp
 10921	`Bouguer's cuttlefish.'"
 10922	
 10923	"What length was it?" asked the Canadian.
 10924	
 10925	"Did it not measure about six yards?" said Conseil, who, posted at the
 10926	window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.
 10927	
 10928	"Precisely," I replied.
 10929	
 10930	"Its head," rejoined Conseil, "was it not crowned with eight tentacles,
 10931	that beat the water like a nest of serpents?"
 10932	
 10933	"Precisely."
 10934	
 10935	"Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable
 10936	development?"
 10937	
 10938	"Yes, Conseil."
 10939	
 10940	"And was not its mouth like a parrot's beak?"
 10941	
 10942	"Exactly, Conseil."
 10943	
 10944	"Very well! no offence to master," he replied, quietly; "if this is not
 10945	Bouguer's cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers."
 10946	
 10947	I looked at Conseil.  Ned Land hurried to the window.
 10948	
 10949	"What a horrible beast!" he cried.
 10950	
 10951	I looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust.
 10952	Before my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends
 10953	of the marvellous.  It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards
 10954	long.  It swam crossways in the direction of the Nautilus with great
 10955	speed, watching us with its enormous staring green eyes.  Its eight
 10956	arms, or rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of
 10957	cephalopod to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were
 10958	twisted like the furies' hair.  One could see the 250 air holes on the
 10959	inner side of the tentacles.  The monster's mouth, a horned beak like a
 10960	parrot's, opened and shut vertically.  Its tongue, a horned substance,
 10961	furnished with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from
 10962	this veritable pair of shears.  What a freak of nature, a bird's beak
 10963	on a mollusc!  Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might
 10964	weigh 4,000 to 5,000 lb.; the, varying colour changing with great
 10965	rapidity, according to the irritation of the animal, passed
 10966	successively from livid grey to reddish brown.  What irritated this
 10967	mollusc?  No doubt the presence of the Nautilus, more formidable than
 10968	itself, and on which its suckers or its jaws had no hold.  Yet, what
 10969	monsters these poulps are! what vitality the Creator has given them!
 10970	what vigour in their movements! and they possess three hearts!  Chance
 10971	had brought us in presence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to
 10972	lose the opportunity of carefully studying this specimen of
 10973	cephalopods.  I overcame the horror that inspired me, and, taking a
 10974	pencil, began to draw it.
 10975	
 10976	"Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw," said Conseil.
 10977	
 10978	"No," replied the Canadian; "for this is whole, and the other had lost
 10979	its tail."
 10980	
 10981	"That is no reason," I replied.  "The arms and tails of these animals
 10982	are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer's
 10983	cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow."
 10984	
 10985	By this time other poulps appeared at the port light.  I counted seven.
 10986	They formed a procession after the Nautilus, and I heard their beaks
 10987	gnashing against the iron hull.  I continued my work.  These monsters
 10988	kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.
 10989	Suddenly the Nautilus stopped.  A shock made it tremble in every plate.
 10990	
 10991	"Have we struck anything?"  I asked.
 10992	
 10993	"In any case," replied the Canadian, "we shall be free, for we are
 10994	floating."
 10995	
 10996	The Nautilus was floating, no doubt, but it did not move.  A minute
 10997	passed.  Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the
 10998	drawing-room. I had not seen him for some time.  He seemed dull.
 10999	Without noticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the
 11000	poulps, and said something to his lieutenant.  The latter went out.
 11001	Soon the panels were shut.  The ceiling was lighted.  I went towards
 11002	the Captain.
 11003	
 11004	"A curious collection of poulps?"  I said.
 11005	
 11006	"Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist," he replied; "and we are going to fight
 11007	them, man to beast."
 11008	
 11009	I looked at him.  I thought I had not heard aright.
 11010	
 11011	"Man to beast?"  I repeated.
 11012	
 11013	"Yes, sir.  The screw is stopped.  I think that the horny jaws of one
 11014	of the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades.  That is what prevents
 11015	our moving."
 11016	
 11017	"What are you going to do?"
 11018	
 11019	"Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin."
 11020	
 11021	"A difficult enterprise."
 11022	
 11023	"Yes, indeed.  The electric bullets are powerless against the soft
 11024	flesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off.  But we
 11025	shall attack them with the hatchet."
 11026	
 11027	"And the harpoon, sir," said the Canadian, "if you do not refuse my
 11028	help."
 11029	
 11030	"I will accept it, Master Land."
 11031	
 11032	"We will follow you," I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went
 11033	towards the central staircase.
 11034	
 11035	There, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.
 11036	Conseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon.  The
 11037	Nautilus had then risen to the surface.  One of the sailors, posted on
 11038	the top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels.  But hardly were
 11039	the screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently
 11040	drawn by the suckers of a poulp's arm.  Immediately one of these arms
 11041	slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above.
 11042	With one blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle,
 11043	that slid wriggling down the ladder.  Just as we were pressing one on
 11044	the other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came
 11045	down on the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with
 11046	irresistible power.  Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out.  We
 11047	hurried after him.
 11048	
 11049	What a scene!  The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the
 11050	suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.
 11051	He rattled in his throat, he was stifled, he cried, "Help! help!"
 11052	These words, spoken in French, startled me!  I had a fellow-countryman
 11053	on board, perhaps several!  That heart-rending cry!  I shall hear it
 11054	all my life.  The unfortunate man was lost.  Who could rescue him from
 11055	that powerful pressure?  However, Captain Nemo had rushed to the poulp,
 11056	and with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm.  His lieutenant
 11057	struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of
 11058	the Nautilus.  The crew fought with their axes.  The Canadian, Conseil,
 11059	and I buried our weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk
 11060	penetrated the atmosphere.  It was horrible!
 11061	
 11062	For one instant, I thought the unhappy man, entangled with the poulp,
 11063	would be torn from its powerful suction.  Seven of the eight arms had
 11064	been cut off.  One only wriggled in the air, brandishing the victim
 11065	like a feather.  But just as Captain Nemo and his lieutenant threw
 11066	themselves on it, the animal ejected a stream of black liquid.  We were
 11067	blinded with it.  When the cloud dispersed, the cuttlefish had
 11068	disappeared, and my unfortunate countryman with it.  Ten or twelve
 11069	poulps now invaded the platform and sides of the Nautilus.  We rolled
 11070	pell-mell into the midst of this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the
 11071	platform in the waves of blood and ink.  It seemed as though these
 11072	slimy tentacles sprang up like the hydra's heads.  Ned Land's harpoon,
 11073	at each stroke, was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish.
 11074	But my bold companion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a
 11075	monster he had not been able to avoid.
 11076	
 11077	Ah! how my heart beat with emotion and horror!  The formidable beak of
 11078	a cuttlefish was open over Ned Land.  The unhappy man would be cut in
 11079	two.  I rushed to his succour.  But Captain Nemo was before me; his axe
 11080	disappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, the
 11081	Canadian, rising, plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the
 11082	poulp.
 11083	
 11084	"I owed myself this revenge!" said the Captain to the Canadian.
 11085	
 11086	Ned bowed without replying.  The combat had lasted a quarter of an
 11087	hour.  The monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and
 11088	disappeared under the waves.  Captain Nemo, covered with blood, nearly
 11089	exhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his
 11090	companions, and great tears gathered in his eyes.
 11091	
 11092	
 11093	
 11094	CHAPTER XIX
 11095	
 11096	THE GULF STREAM
 11097	
 11098	This terrible scene of the 20th of April none of us can ever forget.  I
 11099	have written it under the influence of violent emotion.  Since then I
 11100	have revised the recital; I have read it to Conseil and to the
 11101	Canadian.  They found it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to
 11102	effect.  To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of the most
 11103	illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep.
 11104	
 11105	I have said that Captain Nemo wept while watching the waves; his grief
 11106	was great.  It was the second companion he had lost since our arrival
 11107	on board, and what a death!  That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by
 11108	the dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws, would not rest
 11109	with his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery!  In the midst of the
 11110	struggle, it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that
 11111	had torn my heart.  The poor Frenchman, forgetting his conventional
 11112	language, had taken to his own mother tongue, to utter a last appeal!
 11113	Amongst the crew of the Nautilus, associated with the body and soul of
 11114	the Captain, recoiling like him from all contact with men, I had a
 11115	fellow-countryman. Did he alone represent France in this mysterious
 11116	association, evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities?
 11117	It was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before
 11118	my mind!
 11119	
 11120	Captain Nemo entered his room, and I saw him no more for some time.
 11121	But that he was sad and irresolute I could see by the vessel, of which
 11122	he was the soul, and which received all his impressions.  The Nautilus
 11123	did not keep on in its settled course; it floated about like a corpse
 11124	at the will of the waves.  It went at random.  He could not tear
 11125	himself away from the scene of the last struggle, from this sea that
 11126	had devoured one of his men.  Ten days passed thus.  It was not till
 11127	the 1st of May that the Nautilus resumed its northerly course, after
 11128	having sighted the Bahamas at the mouth of the Bahama Canal.  We were
 11129	then following the current from the largest river to the sea, that has
 11130	its banks, its fish, and its proper temperatures.  I mean the Gulf
 11131	Stream.  It is really a river, that flows freely to the middle of the
 11132	Atlantic, and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters.  It is a
 11133	salt river, salter than the surrounding sea.  Its mean depth is 1,500
 11134	fathoms, its mean breadth ten miles.  In certain places the current
 11135	flows with the speed of two miles and a half an hour.  The body of its
 11136	waters is more considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe.
 11137	It was on this ocean river that the Nautilus then sailed.
 11138	
 11139	I must add that, during the night, the phosphorescent waters of the
 11140	Gulf Stream rivalled the electric power of our watch-light, especially
 11141	in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently.  May 8th, we
 11142	were still crossing Cape Hatteras, at the height of the North Caroline.
 11143	The width of the Gulf Stream there is seventy-five miles, and its depth
 11144	210 yards.  The Nautilus still went at random; all supervision seemed
 11145	abandoned.  I thought that, under these circumstances, escape would be
 11146	possible.  Indeed, the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy
 11147	refuge.  The sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply
 11148	between New York or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and overrun day and
 11149	night by the little schooners coasting about the several parts of the
 11150	American coast.  We could hope to be picked up.  It was a favourable
 11151	opportunity, notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the
 11152	Nautilus from the coasts of the Union.  One unfortunate circumstance
 11153	thwarted the Canadian's plans.  The weather was very bad.  We were
 11154	nearing those shores where tempests are so frequent, that country of
 11155	waterspouts and cyclones actually engendered by the current of the Gulf
 11156	Stream.  To tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction.  Ned
 11157	Land owned this himself.  He fretted, seized with nostalgia that flight
 11158	only could cure.
 11159	
 11160	"Master," he said that day to me, "this must come to an end.  I must
 11161	make a clean breast of it.  This Nemo is leaving land and going up to
 11162	the north.  But I declare to you that I have had enough of the South
 11163	Pole, and I will not follow him to the North."
 11164	
 11165	"What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now?"
 11166	
 11167	"We must speak to the Captain," said he; "you said nothing when we were
 11168	in your native seas.  I will speak, now we are in mine.  When I think
 11169	that before long the Nautilus will be by Nova Scotia, and that there
 11170	near New foundland is a large bay, and into that bay the St. Lawrence
 11171	empties itself, and that the St. Lawrence is my river, the river by
 11172	Quebec, my native town--when I think of this, I feel furious, it makes
 11173	my hair stand on end.  Sir, I would rather throw myself into the sea!
 11174	I will not stay here!  I am stifled!"
 11175	
 11176	The Canadian was evidently losing all patience.  His vigorous nature
 11177	could not stand this prolonged imprisonment.  His face altered daily;
 11178	his temper became more surly.  I knew what he must suffer, for I was
 11179	seized with home-sickness myself.  Nearly seven months had passed
 11180	without our having had any news from land; Captain Nemo's isolation,
 11181	his altered spirits, especially since the fight with the poulps, his
 11182	taciturnity, all made me view things in a different light.
 11183	
 11184	"Well, sir?" said Ned, seeing I did not reply.
 11185	
 11186	"Well, Ned, do you wish me to ask Captain Nemo his intentions
 11187	concerning us?"
 11188	
 11189	"Yes, sir."
 11190	
 11191	"Although he has already made them known?"
 11192	
 11193	"Yes; I wish it settled finally.  Speak for me, in my name only, if you
 11194	like."
 11195	
 11196	"But I so seldom meet him.  He avoids me."
 11197	
 11198	"That is all the more reason for you to go to see him."
 11199	
 11200	I went to my room.  From thence I meant to go to Captain Nemo's.  It
 11201	would not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip.  I knocked at
 11202	the door.  No answer.  I knocked again, then turned the handle.  The
 11203	door opened, I went in.  The Captain was there.  Bending over his
 11204	work-table, he had not heard me.  Resolved not to go without having
 11205	spoken, I approached him.  He raised his head quickly, frowned, and
 11206	said roughly, "You here!  What do you want?"
 11207	
 11208	"To speak to you, Captain."
 11209	
 11210	"But I am busy, sir; I am working.  I leave you at liberty to shut
 11211	yourself up; cannot I be allowed the same?"
 11212	
 11213	This reception was not encouraging; but I was determined to hear and
 11214	answer everything.
 11215	
 11216	"Sir," I said coldly, "I have to speak to you on a matter that admits
 11217	of no delay."
 11218	
 11219	"What is that, sir?" he replied, ironically.  "Have you discovered
 11220	something that has escaped me, or has the sea delivered up any new
 11221	secrets?"
 11222	
 11223	We were at cross-purposes. But, before I could reply, he showed me an
 11224	open manuscript on his table, and said, in a more serious tone, "Here,
 11225	M. Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages.  It contains
 11226	the sum of my studies of the sea; and, if it please God, it shall not
 11227	perish with me.  This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with
 11228	the history of my life, will be shut up in a little floating case.  The
 11229	last survivor of all of us on board the Nautilus will throw this case
 11230	into the sea, and it will go whither it is borne by the waves."
 11231	
 11232	This man's name! his history written by himself!  His mystery would
 11233	then be revealed some day.
 11234	
 11235	"Captain," I said, "I can but approve of the idea that makes you act
 11236	thus.  The result of your studies must not be lost.  But the means you
 11237	employ seem to me to be primitive.  Who knows where the winds will
 11238	carry this case, and in whose hands it will fall?  Could you not use
 11239	some other means?  Could not you, or one of yours----"
 11240	
 11241	"Never, sir!" he said, hastily interrupting me.
 11242	
 11243	"But I and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store;
 11244	and, if you will put us at liberty----"
 11245	
 11246	"At liberty?" said the Captain, rising.
 11247	
 11248	"Yes, sir; that is the subject on which I wish to question you.  For
 11249	seven months we have been here on board, and I ask you to-day, in the
 11250	name of my companions and in my own, if your intention is to keep us
 11251	here always?"
 11252	
 11253	"M. Aronnax, I will answer you to-day as I did seven months ago:
 11254	Whoever enters the Nautilus, must never quit it."
 11255	
 11256	"You impose actual slavery upon us!"
 11257	
 11258	"Give it what name you please."
 11259	
 11260	"But everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty."
 11261	
 11262	"Who denies you this right?  Have I ever tried to chain you with an
 11263	oath?"
 11264	
 11265	He looked at me with his arms crossed.
 11266	
 11267	"Sir," I said, "to return a second time to this subject will be neither
 11268	to your nor to my taste; but, as we have entered upon it, let us go
 11269	through with it.  I repeat, it is not only myself whom it concerns.
 11270	Study is to me a relief, a diversion, a passion that could make me
 11271	forget everything.  Like you, I am willing to live obscure, in the
 11272	frail hope of bequeathing one day, to future time, the result of my
 11273	labours.  But it is otherwise with Ned Land.  Every man, worthy of the
 11274	name, deserves some consideration.  Have you thought that love of
 11275	liberty, hatred of slavery, can give rise to schemes of revenge in a
 11276	nature like the Canadian's; that he could think, attempt, and try----"
 11277	
 11278	I was silenced; Captain Nemo rose.
 11279	
 11280	"Whatever Ned Land thinks of, attempts, or tries, what does it matter
 11281	to me?  I did not seek him!  It is not for my pleasure that I keep him
 11282	on board!  As for you, M. Aronnax, you are one of those who can
 11283	understand everything, even silence.  I have nothing more to say to
 11284	you.  Let this first time you have come to treat of this subject be the
 11285	last, for a second time I will not listen to you."
 11286	
 11287	I retired.  Our situation was critical.  I related my conversation to
 11288	my two companions.
 11289	
 11290	"We know now," said Ned, "that we can expect nothing from this man.
 11291	The Nautilus is nearing Long Island.  We will escape, whatever the
 11292	weather may be."
 11293	
 11294	But the sky became more and more threatening.  Symptoms of a hurricane
 11295	became manifest.  The atmosphere was becoming white and misty.  On the
 11296	horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of
 11297	cumuli.  Other low clouds passed swiftly by.  The swollen sea rose in
 11298	huge billows.  The birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels,
 11299	those friends of the storm.  The barometer fell sensibly, and indicated
 11300	an extreme extension of the vapours.  The mixture of the storm glass
 11301	was decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the
 11302	atmosphere.  The tempest burst on the 18th of May, just as the Nautilus
 11303	was floating off Long Island, some miles from the port of New York.  I
 11304	can describe this strife of the elements! for, instead of fleeing to
 11305	the depths of the sea, Captain Nemo, by an unaccountable caprice, would
 11306	brave it at the surface.  The wind blew from the south-west at first.
 11307	Captain Nemo, during the squalls, had taken his place on the platform.
 11308	He had made himself fast, to prevent being washed overboard by the
 11309	monstrous waves.  I had hoisted myself up, and made myself fast also,
 11310	dividing my admiration between the tempest and this extraordinary man
 11311	who was coping with it.  The raging sea was swept by huge cloud-drifts,
 11312	which were actually saturated with the waves.  The Nautilus, sometimes
 11313	lying on its side, sometimes standing up like a mast, rolled and
 11314	pitched terribly.  About five o'clock a torrent of rain fell, that
 11315	lulled neither sea nor wind.  The hurri cane blew nearly forty leagues
 11316	an hour.  It is under these conditions that it overturns houses, breaks
 11317	iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders.  However, the Nautilus, in
 11318	the midst of the tempest, confirmed the words of a clever engineer,
 11319	"There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy the sea." This was
 11320	not a resisting rock; it was a steel spindle, obedient and movable,
 11321	without rigging or masts, that braved its fury with impunity.  However,
 11322	I watched these raging waves attentively.  They measured fifteen feet
 11323	in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their speed of propagation
 11324	was thirty feet per second.  Their bulk and power increased with the
 11325	depth of the water.  Such waves as these, at the Hebrides, have
 11326	displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lb.  They are they which, in the
 11327	tempest of December 23rd, 1864, after destroying the town of Yeddo, in
 11328	Japan, broke the same day on the shores of America.  The intensity of
 11329	the tempest increased with the night.  The barometer, as in 1860 at
 11330	Reunion during a cyclone, fell seven-tenths at the close of day.  I saw
 11331	a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully.  She was trying
 11332	to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves.  It was
 11333	probably one of the steamers of the line from New York to Liverpool, or
 11334	Havre.  It soon disappeared in the gloom.  At ten o'clock in the
 11335	evening the sky was on fire.  The atmosphere was streaked with vivid
 11336	lightning.  I could not bear the brightness of it; while the captain,
 11337	looking at it, seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest.  A terrible
 11338	noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of the
 11339	crushed waves, the roaring of the wind, and the claps of thunder.  The
 11340	wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone,
 11341	rising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and
 11342	south, in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the
 11343	southern hemisphere.  Ah, that Gulf Stream!  It deserves its name of
 11344	the King of Tempests.  It is that which causes those formidable
 11345	cyclones, by the difference of temperature between its air and its
 11346	currents.  A shower of fire had succeeded the rain.  The drops of water
 11347	were changed to sharp spikes.  One would have thought that Captain Nemo
 11348	was courting a death worthy of himself, a death by lightning.  As the
 11349	Nautilus, pitching dreadfully, raised its steel spur in the air, it
 11350	seemed to act as a conductor, and I saw long sparks burst from it.
 11351	Crushed and without strength I crawled to the panel, opened it, and
 11352	descended to the saloon.  The storm was then at its height.  It was
 11353	impossible to stand upright in the interior of the Nautilus.  Captain
 11354	Nemo came down about twelve.  I heard the reservoirs filling by
 11355	degrees, and the Nautilus sank slowly beneath the waves.  Through the
 11356	open windows in the saloon I saw large fish terrified, passing like
 11357	phantoms in the water.  Some were struck before my eyes.  The Nautilus
 11358	was still descending.  I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we
 11359	should find a calm.  But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated
 11360	for that.  We had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in
 11361	the bowels of the deep.  But there, what quiet, what silence, what
 11362	peace!  Who could have told that such a hurricane had been let loose on
 11363	the surface of that ocean?
 11364	
 11365	
 11366	
 11367	CHAPTER XX
 11368	
 11369	FROM LATITUDE 47° 24' TO LONGITUDE 17° 28'
 11370	
 11371	In consequence of the storm, we had been thrown eastward once more.
 11372	All hope of escape on the shores of New York or St. Lawrence had faded
 11373	away; and poor Ned, in despair, had isolated himself like Captain Nemo.
 11374	Conseil and I, however, never left each other.  I said that the
 11375	Nautilus had gone aside to the east.  I should have said (to be more
 11376	exact) the north-east. For some days, it wandered first on the surface,
 11377	and then beneath it, amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors.  What
 11378	accidents are due to these thick fogs!  What shocks upon these reefs
 11379	when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves!  What collisions
 11380	between vessels, in spite of their warning lights, whistles, and alarm
 11381	bells!  And the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle,
 11382	where still lie all the conquered of the ocean; some old and already
 11383	encrusted, others fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper
 11384	plates the brilliancy of our lantern.
 11385	
 11386	On the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of the Bank of
 11387	Newfoundland.  This bank consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic
 11388	matter, brought either from the Equator by the Gulf Stream, or from the
 11389	North Pole by the counter-current of cold water which skirts the
 11390	American coast.  There also are heaped up those erratic blocks which
 11391	are carried along by the broken ice; and close by, a vast charnel-house
 11392	of molluscs, which perish here by millions.  The depth of the sea is
 11393	not great at Newfoundland--not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but
 11394	towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms.  There the Gulf
 11395	Stream widens.  It loses some of its speed and some of its temperature,
 11396	but it becomes a sea.
 11397	
 11398	It was on the 17th of May, about 500 miles from Heart's Content, at a
 11399	depth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the electric cable lying
 11400	on the bottom.  Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it, thought at
 11401	first that it was a gigantic sea-serpent. But I undeceived the worthy
 11402	fellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the
 11403	laying of this cable.  The first one was laid in the years 1857 and
 11404	1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any
 11405	longer.  In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring
 11406	2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on
 11407	the Great Eastern.  This attempt also failed.
 11408	
 11409	On the 25th of May the Nautilus, being at a depth of more than 1,918
 11410	fathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which
 11411	ruined the enterprise.  It was within 638 miles of the coast of
 11412	Ireland; and at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that
 11413	communication with Europe had ceased.  The electricians on board
 11414	resolved to cut the cable before fishing it up, and at eleven o'clock
 11415	at night they had recovered the damaged part.  They made another point
 11416	and spliced it, and it was once more submerged.  But some days after it
 11417	broke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured.
 11418	The Americans, however, were not discouraged.  Cyrus Field, the bold
 11419	promoter of the enterprise, as he had sunk all his own fortune, set a
 11420	new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable
 11421	was constructed on better principles.  The bundles of conducting wires
 11422	were each enveloped in gutta-percha, and protected by a wadding of
 11423	hemp, contained in a metallic covering.  The Great Eastern sailed on
 11424	the 13th of July, 1866.  The operation worked well.  But one incident
 11425	occurred.  Several times in unrolling the cable they observed that
 11426	nails had recently been forced into it, evidently with the motive of
 11427	destroying it.  Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consulted
 11428	together, and had it posted up that, if the offender was surprised on
 11429	board, he would be thrown without further trial into the sea.  From
 11430	that time the criminal attempt was never repeated.
 11431	
 11432	On the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than 500 miles from
 11433	Newfoundland, when they telegraphed from Ireland the news of the
 11434	armistice concluded between Prussia and Austria after Sadowa.  On the
 11435	27th, in the midst of heavy fogs, they reached the port of Heart's
 11436	Content.  The enterprise was successfully terminated; and for its first
 11437	despatch, young America addressed old Europe in these words of wisdom,
 11438	so rarely understood:  "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
 11439	peace, goodwill towards men."
 11440	
 11441	I did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state,
 11442	such as it was on leaving the manufactory.  The long serpent, covered
 11443	with the remains of shells, bristling with foraminiferae, was encrusted
 11444	with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring
 11445	molluscs.  It lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea, and
 11446	under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark
 11447	which passes from Europe to America in .32 of a second.  Doubtless this
 11448	cable will last for a great length of time, for they find that the
 11449	gutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water. Besides, on this
 11450	level, so well chosen, the cable is never so deeply submerged as to
 11451	cause it to break.  The Nautilus followed it to the lowest depth, which
 11452	was more than 2,212 fathoms, and there it lay without any anchorage;
 11453	and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken place in
 11454	1863.  The bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100 miles
 11455	broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed without its summit
 11456	appearing above the waves.  This valley is closed at the east by a
 11457	perpendicular wall more than 2,000 yards high.  We arrived there on the
 11458	28th of May, and the Nautilus was then not more than 120 miles from
 11459	Ireland.
 11460	
 11461	Was Captain Nemo going to land on the British Isles?  No. To my great
 11462	surprise he made for the south, once more coming back towards European
 11463	seas.  In rounding the Emerald Isle, for one instant I caught sight of
 11464	Cape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving
 11465	Glasgow or Liverpool.  An important question then arose in my mind.
 11466	Did the Nautilus dare entangle itself in the Manche?  Ned Land, who had
 11467	re-appeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to question
 11468	me.  How could I answer?  Captain Nemo remained invisible.  After
 11469	having shown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he going to
 11470	show me the coast of France?
 11471	
 11472	But the Nautilus was still going southward.  On the 30th of May, it
 11473	passed in sight of Land's End, between the extreme point of England and
 11474	the Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard.  If we wished to enter
 11475	the Manche, he must go straight to the east.  He did not do so.
 11476	
 11477	During the whole of the 31st of May, the Nautilus described a series of
 11478	circles on the water, which greatly interested me.  It seemed to be
 11479	seeking a spot it had some trouble in finding.  At noon, Captain Nemo
 11480	himself came to work the ship's log.  He spoke no word to me, but
 11481	seemed gloomier than ever.  What could sadden him thus?  Was it his
 11482	proxim ity to European shores?  Had he some recollections of his
 11483	abandoned country?  If not, what did he feel?  Remorse or regret?  For
 11484	a long while this thought haunted my mind, and I had a kind of
 11485	presentiment that before long chance would betray the captain's secrets.
 11486	
 11487	The next day, the 1st of June, the Nautilus continued the same process.
 11488	It was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean.  Captain
 11489	Nemo took the sun's altitude as he had done the day before.  The sea
 11490	was beautiful, the sky clear.  About eight miles to the east, a large
 11491	steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon.  No flag fluttered from
 11492	its mast, and I could not discover its nationality.  Some minutes
 11493	before the sun passed the meridian, Captain Nemo took his sextant, and
 11494	watched with great attention.  The perfect rest of the water greatly
 11495	helped the operation.  The Nautilus was motionless; it neither rolled
 11496	nor pitched.
 11497	
 11498	I was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain
 11499	pronounced these words:  "It is here."
 11500	
 11501	He turned and went below.  Had he seen the vessel which was changing
 11502	its course and seemed to be nearing us?  I could not tell.  I returned
 11503	to the saloon.  The panels closed, I heard the hissing of the water in
 11504	the reservoirs.  The Nautilus began to sink, following a vertical line,
 11505	for its screw communicated no motion to it.  Some minutes later it
 11506	stopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground.
 11507	The luminous ceiling was darkened, then the panels were opened, and
 11508	through the glass I saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of
 11509	our lantern for at least half a mile round us.
 11510	
 11511	I looked to the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet
 11512	waters.  But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance,
 11513	which at once attracted my attention.  One would have thought it a ruin
 11514	buried under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of
 11515	snow.  Upon examining the mass attentively, I could recognise the
 11516	ever-thickening form of a vessel bare of its masts, which must have
 11517	sunk.  It certainly belonged to past times.  This wreck, to be thus
 11518	encrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count
 11519	many years passed at the bottom of the ocean.
 11520	
 11521	What was this vessel?  Why did the Nautilus visit its tomb?  Could it
 11522	have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water?  I
 11523	knew not what to think, when near me in a slow voice I heard Captain
 11524	Nemo say:
 11525	
 11526	"At one time this ship was called the Marseillais.  It carried
 11527	seventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762.  In 1778, the 13th of
 11528	August, commanded by La Poype-Ver trieux, it fought boldly against the
 11529	Preston.  In 1779, on the 4th of July, it was at the taking of Grenada,
 11530	with the squadron of Admiral Estaing.  In 1781, on the 5th of
 11531	September, it took part in the battle of Comte de Grasse, in Chesapeake
 11532	Bay.  In 1794, the French Republic changed its name.  On the 16th of
 11533	April, in the same year, it joined the squadron of Villaret Joyeuse, at
 11534	Brest, being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from
 11535	America, under the command of Admiral Van Stebel.  On the 11th and 12th
 11536	Prairal of the second year, this squadron fell in with an English
 11537	vessel.  Sir, to-day is the 13th Prairal, the first of June, 1868.  It
 11538	is now seventy-four years ago, day for day on this very spot, in
 11539	latitude 47° 24', longitude 17° 28', that this vessel, after
 11540	fighting heroically, losing its three masts, with the water in its
 11541	hold, and the third of its crew disabled, preferred sinking with its
 11542	356 sailors to surrendering; and, nailing its colours to the poop,
 11543	disappeared under the waves to the cry of `Long live the Republic!'"
 11544	
 11545	"The Avenger!"  I exclaimed.
 11546	
 11547	"Yes, sir, the Avenger!  A good name!" muttered Captain Nemo, crossing
 11548	his arms.
 11549	
 11550	
 11551	
 11552	CHAPTER XXI
 11553	
 11554	A HECATOMB
 11555	
 11556	The way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of the
 11557	patriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this
 11558	strange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the
 11559	significance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply
 11560	on my mind.  My eyes did not leave the Captain, who, with his hand
 11561	stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious
 11562	wreck.  Perhaps I was never to know who he was, from whence he came, or
 11563	where he was going to, but I saw the man move, and apart from the
 11564	_savant_.  It was no common misanthropy which had shut Captain Nemo and
 11565	his companions within the Nautilus, but a hatred, either monstrous or
 11566	sublime, which time could never weaken.  Did this hatred still seek for
 11567	vengeance?  The future would soon teach me that.  But the Nautilus was
 11568	rising slowly to the surface of the sea, and the form of the Avenger
 11569	disappeared by degrees from my sight.  Soon a slight rolling told me
 11570	that we were in the open air.  At that moment a dull boom was heard.  I
 11571	looked at the Captain.  He did not move.
 11572	
 11573	"Captain?" said I.
 11574	
 11575	He did not answer.  I left him and mounted the platform.  Conseil and
 11576	the Canadian were already there.
 11577	
 11578	"Where did that sound come from?"  I asked.
 11579	
 11580	"It was a gunshot," replied Ned Land.
 11581	
 11582	I looked in the direction of the vessel I had already seen.  It was
 11583	nearing the Nautilus, and we could see that it was putting on steam.
 11584	It was within six miles of us.
 11585	
 11586	"What is that ship, Ned?"
 11587	
 11588	"By its rigging, and the height of its lower masts," said the Canadian,
 11589	"I bet she is a ship-of-war. May it reach us; and, if necessary, sink
 11590	this cursed Nautilus."
 11591	
 11592	"Friend Ned," replied Conseil, "what harm can it do to the Nautilus?
 11593	Can it attack it beneath the waves?  Can its cannonade us at the bottom
 11594	of the sea?"
 11595	
 11596	"Tell me, Ned," said I, "can you recognise what country she belongs to?"
 11597	
 11598	The Canadian knitted his eyebrows, dropped his eyelids, and screwed up
 11599	the corners of his eyes, and for a few moments fixed a piercing look
 11600	upon the vessel.
 11601	
 11602	"No, sir," he replied; "I cannot tell what nation she belongs to, for
 11603	she shows no colours.  But I can declare she is a man-of-war, for a
 11604	long pennant flutters from her main mast."
 11605	
 11606	For a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards
 11607	us.  I could not, however, believe that she could see the Nautilus from
 11608	that distance; and still less that she could know what this submarine
 11609	engine was.  Soon the Canadian informed me that she was a large,
 11610	armoured, two-decker ram.  A thick black smoke was pouring from her two
 11611	funnels.  Her closely-furled sails were stopped to her yards.  She
 11612	hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak. The distance prevented us from
 11613	distinguishing the colours of her pennant, which floated like a thin
 11614	ribbon.  She advanced rapidly.  If Captain Nemo allowed her to
 11615	approach, there was a chance of salvation for us.
 11616	
 11617	"Sir," said Ned Land, "if that vessel passes within a mile of us I
 11618	shall throw myself into the sea, and I should advise you to do the
 11619	same."
 11620	
 11621	I did not reply to the Canadian's suggestion, but continued watching
 11622	the ship.  Whether English, French, American, or Russian, she would be
 11623	sure to take us in if we could only reach her.  Presently a white smoke
 11624	burst from the fore part of the vessel; some seconds after, the water,
 11625	agitated by the fall of a heavy body, splashed the stern of the
 11626	Nautilus, and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear.
 11627	
 11628	"What! they are firing at us!"  I exclaimed.
 11629	
 11630	"So please you, sir," said Ned, "they have recognised the unicorn, and
 11631	they are firing at us."
 11632	
 11633	"But," I exclaimed, "surely they can see that there are men in the
 11634	case?"
 11635	
 11636	"It is, perhaps, because of that," replied Ned Land, looking at me.
 11637	
 11638	A whole flood of light burst upon my mind.  Doubtless they knew now how
 11639	to believe the stories of the pretended monster.  No doubt, on board
 11640	the Abraham Lincoln, when the Canadian struck it with the harpoon,
 11641	Commander Farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine
 11642	vessel, more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean.  Yes, it must have
 11643	been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of
 11644	destruction.  Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, Captain Nemo
 11645	employed the Nautilus in works of vengeance.  On the night when we were
 11646	imprisoned in that cell, in the midst of the Indian Ocean, had he not
 11647	attacked some vessel?  The man buried in the coral cemetery, had he not
 11648	been a victim to the shock caused by the Nautilus?  Yes, I repeat it,
 11649	it must be so.  One part of the mysterious existence of Captain Nemo
 11650	had been unveiled; and, if his identity had not been recognised, at
 11651	least, the nations united against him were no longer hunting a
 11652	chimerical creature, but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against
 11653	them.  All the formidable past rose before me.  Instead of meeting
 11654	friends on board the approaching ship, we could only expect pitiless
 11655	enemies.  But the shot rattled about us.  Some of them struck the sea
 11656	and ricochetted, losing themselves in the distance.  But none touched
 11657	the Nautilus.  The vessel was not more than three miles from us.  In
 11658	spite of the serious cannonade, Captain Nemo did not appear on the
 11659	platform; but, if one of the conical projectiles had struck the shell
 11660	of the Nautilus, it would have been fatal.  The Canadian then said,
 11661	"Sir, we must do all we can to get out of this dilemma.  Let us signal
 11662	them.  They will then, perhaps, understand that we are honest folks."
 11663	
 11664	Ned Land took his handkerchief to wave in the air; but he had scarcely
 11665	displayed it, when he was struck down by an iron hand, and fell, in
 11666	spite of his great strength, upon the deck.
 11667	
 11668	"Fool!" exclaimed the Captain, "do you wish to be pierced by the spur
 11669	of the Nautilus before it is hurled at this vessel?"
 11670	
 11671	Captain Nemo was terrible to hear; he was still more terrible to see.
 11672	His face was deadly pale, with a spasm at his heart.  For an instant it
 11673	must have ceased to beat.  His pupils were fearfully contracted.  He
 11674	did not speak, he roared, as, with his body thrown forward, he wrung
 11675	the Canadian's shoulders.  Then, leaving him, and turning to the ship
 11676	of war, whose shot was still raining around him, he exclaimed, with a
 11677	powerful voice, "Ah, ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am!  I
 11678	do not want your colours to know you by!  Look! and I will show you
 11679	mine!"
 11680	
 11681	And on the fore part of the platform Captain Nemo unfurled a black
 11682	flag, similar to the one he had placed at the South Pole.  At that
 11683	moment a shot struck the shell of the Nautilus obliquely, without
 11684	piercing it; and, rebounding near the Captain, was lost in the sea.  He
 11685	shrugged his shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, "Go down, you
 11686	and your companions, go down!"
 11687	
 11688	"Sir," I cried, "are you going to attack this vessel?"
 11689	
 11690	"Sir, I am going to sink it."
 11691	
 11692	"You will not do that?"
 11693	
 11694	"I shall do it," he replied coldly.  "And I advise you not to judge me,
 11695	sir.  Fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen.  The attack
 11696	has begun; go down."
 11697	
 11698	"What is this vessel?"
 11699	
 11700	"You do not know?  Very well! so much the better!  Its nationality to
 11701	you, at least, will be a secret.  Go down!"
 11702	
 11703	We could but obey.  About fifteen of the sailors surrounded the
 11704	Captain, looking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them.
 11705	One could feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul.
 11706	I went down at the moment another projectile struck the Nautilus, and I
 11707	heard the Captain exclaim:
 11708	
 11709	"Strike, mad vessel!  Shower your useless shot!  And then, you will not
 11710	escape the spur of the Nautilus.  But it is not here that you shall
 11711	perish!  I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger!"
 11712	
 11713	I reached my room.  The Captain and his second had remained on the
 11714	platform.  The screw was set in motion, and the Nautilus, moving with
 11715	speed, was soon beyond the reach of the ship's guns.  But the pursuit
 11716	continued, and Captain Nemo contented himself with keeping his distance.
 11717	
 11718	About four in the afternoon, being no longer able to contain my
 11719	impatience, I went to the central staircase.  The panel was open, and I
 11720	ventured on to the platform.  The Captain was still walking up and down
 11721	with an agitated step.  He was looking at the ship, which was five or
 11722	six miles to leeward.
 11723	
 11724	He was going round it like a wild beast, and, drawing it eastward, he
 11725	allowed them to pursue.  But he did not attack.  Perhaps he still
 11726	hesitated?  I wished to mediate once more.  But I had scarcely spoken,
 11727	when Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying:
 11728	
 11729	"I am the law, and I am the judge!  I am the oppressed, and there is
 11730	the oppressor!  Through him I have lost all that I loved, cherished,
 11731	and venerated--country, wife, children, father, and mother.  I saw all
 11732	perish!  All that I hate is there!  Say no more!"
 11733	
 11734	I cast a last look at the man-of-war, which was putting on steam, and
 11735	rejoined Ned and Conseil.
 11736	
 11737	"We will fly!"  I exclaimed.
 11738	
 11739	"Good!" said Ned.  "What is this vessel?"
 11740	
 11741	"I do not know; but, whatever it is, it will be sunk before night.  In
 11742	any case, it is better to perish with it, than be made accomplices in a
 11743	retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge."
 11744	
 11745	"That is my opinion too," said Ned Land, coolly.  "Let us wait for
 11746	night."
 11747	
 11748	Night arrived.  Deep silence reigned on board.  The compass showed that
 11749	the Nautilus had not altered its course.  It was on the surface,
 11750	rolling slightly.  My companions and I resolved to fly when the vessel
 11751	should be near enough either to hear us or to see us; for the moon,
 11752	which would be full in two or three days, shone brightly.  Once on
 11753	board the ship, if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it,
 11754	we could, at least we would, do all that circumstances would allow.
 11755	Several times I thought the Nautilus was preparing for attack; but
 11756	Captain Nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach,
 11757	and then fled once more before it.
 11758	
 11759	Part of the night passed without any incident.  We watched the
 11760	opportunity for action.  We spoke little, for we were too much moved.
 11761	Ned Land would have thrown himself into the sea, but I forced him to
 11762	wait.  According to my idea, the Nautilus would attack the ship at her
 11763	waterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly.
 11764	
 11765	At three in the morning, full of uneasiness, I mounted the platform.
 11766	Captain Nemo had not left it.  He was standing at the fore part near
 11767	his flag, which a slight breeze displayed above his head.  He did not
 11768	take his eyes from the vessel.  The intensity of his look seemed to
 11769	attract, and fascinate, and draw it onward more surely than if he had
 11770	been towing it.  The moon was then passing the meridian.  Jupiter was
 11771	rising in the east.  Amid this peaceful scene of nature, sky and ocean
 11772	rivalled each other in tranquillity, the sea offering to the orbs of
 11773	night the finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their
 11774	image.  As I thought of the deep calm of these elements, compared with
 11775	all those passions brooding imperceptibly within the Nautilus, I
 11776	shuddered.
 11777	
 11778	The vessel was within two miles of us.  It was ever nearing that
 11779	phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the Nautilus.  I
 11780	could see its green and red lights, and its white lantern hanging from
 11781	the large foremast.  An indistinct vibration quivered through its
 11782	rigging, showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost.
 11783	Sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels, shining in the
 11784	atmosphere like stars.
 11785	
 11786	I remained thus until six in the morning, without Captain Nemo noticing
 11787	me.  The ship stood about a mile and a half from us, and with the first
 11788	dawn of day the firing began afresh.  The moment could not be far off
 11789	when, the Nautilus attacking its adversary, my companions and myself
 11790	should for ever leave this man.  I was preparing to go down to remind
 11791	them, when the second mounted the platform, accompanied by several
 11792	sailors.  Captain Nemo either did not or would not see them.  Some
 11793	steps were taken which might be called the signal for action.  They
 11794	were very simple.  The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered,
 11795	and the lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they
 11796	were flush with the deck.  The long surface of the steel cigar no
 11797	longer offered a single point to check its manoeuvres.  I returned to
 11798	the saloon.  The Nautilus still floated; some streaks of light were
 11799	filtering through the liquid beds.  With the undulations of the waves
 11800	the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun, and
 11801	this dreadful day of the 2nd of June had dawned.
 11802	
 11803	At five o'clock, the log showed that the speed of the Nautilus was
 11804	slackening, and I knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer.
 11805	Besides, the reports were heard more distinctly, and the projectiles,
 11806	labouring through the ambient water, were extinguished with a strange
 11807	hissing noise.
 11808	
 11809	"My friends," said I, "the moment is come.  One grasp of the hand, and
 11810	may God protect us!"
 11811	
 11812	Ned Land was resolute, Conseil calm, myself so nervous that I knew not
 11813	how to contain myself.  We all passed into the library; but the moment
 11814	I pushed the door opening on to the central staircase, I heard the
 11815	upper panel close sharply.  The Canadian rushed on to the stairs, but I
 11816	stopped him.  A well-known hissing noise told me that the water was
 11817	running into the reservoirs, and in a few minutes the Nautilus was some
 11818	yards beneath the surface of the waves.  I understood the manoeuvre.
 11819	It was too late to act.  The Nautilus did not wish to strike at the
 11820	impenetrable cuirass, but below the water-line, where the metallic
 11821	covering no longer protected it.
 11822	
 11823	We were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama
 11824	that was preparing.  We had scarcely time to reflect; taking refuge in
 11825	my room, we looked at each other without speaking.  A deep stupor had
 11826	taken hold of my mind:  thought seemed to stand still.  I was in that
 11827	painful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report.  I waited, I
 11828	listened, every sense was merged in that of hearing!  The speed of the
 11829	Nautilus was accelerated.  It was preparing to rush.  The whole ship
 11830	trembled.  Suddenly I screamed.  I felt the shock, but comparatively
 11831	light.  I felt the penetrating power of the steel spur.  I heard
 11832	rattlings and scrapings.  But the Nautilus, carried along by its
 11833	propelling power, passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle
 11834	through sailcloth!
 11835	
 11836	I could stand it no longer.  Mad, out of my mind, I rushed from my room
 11837	into the saloon.  Captain Nemo was there, mute, gloomy, implacable; he
 11838	was looking through the port panel.  A large mass cast a shadow on the
 11839	water; and, that it might lose nothing of her agony, the Nautilus was
 11840	going down into the abyss with her.  Ten yards from me I saw the open
 11841	shell, through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder,
 11842	then the double line of guns and the netting.  The bridge was covered
 11843	with black, agitated shadows.
 11844	
 11845	The water was rising.  The poor creatures were crowding the ratlines,
 11846	clinging to the masts, struggling under the water.  It was a human
 11847	ant-heap overtaken by the sea.  Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, my
 11848	hair standing on end, with eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and
 11849	without voice, I too was watching!  An irresistible attraction glued me
 11850	to the glass!  Suddenly an explosion took place.  The compressed air
 11851	blew up her decks, as if the magazines had caught fire.  Then the
 11852	unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly.  Her topmast, laden with victims,
 11853	now appeared; then her spars, bending under the weight of men; and,
 11854	last of all, the top of her mainmast.  Then the dark mass disappeared,
 11855	and with it the dead crew, drawn down by the strong eddy.
 11856	
 11857	I turned to Captain Nemo.  That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel
 11858	of hatred, was still looking.  When all was over, he turned to his
 11859	room, opened the door, and entered.  I followed him with my eyes.  On
 11860	the end wall beneath his heroes, I saw the portrait of a woman, still
 11861	young, and two little children.  Captain Nemo looked at them for some
 11862	moments, stretched his arms towards them, and, kneeling down, burst
 11863	into deep sobs.
 11864	
 11865	
 11866	
 11867	CHAPTER XXII
 11868	
 11869	THE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO
 11870	
 11871	The panels had closed on this dreadful vision, but light had not
 11872	returned to the saloon:  all was silence and darkness within the
 11873	Nautilus.  At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, it was
 11874	leaving this desolate spot.  Whither was it going?  To the north or
 11875	south?  Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation?  I
 11876	had returned to my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained silent
 11877	enough.  I felt an insurmountable horror for Captain Nemo.  Whatever he
 11878	had suffered at the hands of these men, he had no right to punish thus.
 11879	He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least a witness of his
 11880	vengeance.  At eleven the electric light reappeared.  I passed into the
 11881	saloon.  It was deserted.  I consulted the different instruments.  The
 11882	Nautilus was flying northward at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour,
 11883	now on the surface, and now thirty feet below it.  On taking the
 11884	bearings by the chart, I saw that we were passing the mouth of the
 11885	Manche, and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas
 11886	at a frightful speed.  That night we had crossed two hundred leagues of
 11887	the Atlantic.  The shadows fell, and the sea was covered with darkness
 11888	until the rising of the moon.  I went to my room, but could not sleep.
 11889	I was troubled with dreadful nightmare.  The horrible scene of
 11890	destruction was continually before my eyes.  From that day, who could
 11891	tell into what part of the North Atlantic basin the Nautilus would take
 11892	us?  Still with unaccountable speed.  Still in the midst of these
 11893	northern fogs.  Would it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova
 11894	Zembla?  Should we explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea
 11895	of Kara, the Gulf of Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown
 11896	coast of Asia?  I could not say.  I could no longer judge of the time
 11897	that was passing.  The clocks had been stopped on board.  It seemed, as
 11898	in polar countries, that night and day no longer followed their regular
 11899	course.  I felt myself being drawn into that strange region where the
 11900	foundered imagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will.  Like the fabulous
 11901	Gordon Pym, at every moment I expected to see "that veiled human
 11902	figure, of larger proportions than those of any inhabitant of the
 11903	earth, thrown across the cataract which defends the approach to the
 11904	pole." I estimated (though, perhaps, I may be mistaken)--I estimated
 11905	this adventurous course of the Nautilus to have lasted fifteen or
 11906	twenty days.  And I know not how much longer it might have lasted, had
 11907	it not been for the catastrophe which ended this voyage.  Of Captain
 11908	Nemo I saw nothing whatever now, nor of his second.  Not a man of the
 11909	crew was visible for an instant.  The Nautilus was almost incessantly
 11910	under water.  When we came to the surface to renew the air, the panels
 11911	opened and shut mechanically.  There were no more marks on the
 11912	planisphere.  I knew not where we were.  And the Canadian, too, his
 11913	strength and patience at an end, appeared no more.  Conseil could not
 11914	draw a word from him; and, fearing that, in a dreadful fit of madness,
 11915	he might kill himself, watched him with constant devotion.  One morning
 11916	(what date it was I could not say) I had fallen into a heavy sleep
 11917	towards the early hours, a sleep both painful and unhealthy, when I
 11918	suddenly awoke.  Ned Land was leaning over me, saying, in a low voice,
 11919	"We are going to fly."  I sat up.
 11920	
 11921	"When shall we go?"  I asked.
 11922	
 11923	"To-night. All inspection on board the Nautilus seems to have ceased.
 11924	All appear to be stupefied.  You will be ready, sir?"
 11925	
 11926	"Yes; where are we?"
 11927	
 11928	"In sight of land.  I took the reckoning this morning in the
 11929	fog--twenty miles to the east."
 11930	
 11931	"What country is it?"
 11932	
 11933	"I do not know; but, whatever it is, we will take refuge there."
 11934	
 11935	"Yes, Ned, yes.  We will fly to-night, even if the sea should swallow
 11936	us up."
 11937	
 11938	"The sea is bad, the wind violent, but twenty miles in that light boat
 11939	of the Nautilus does not frighten me.  Unknown to the crew, I have been
 11940	able to procure food and some bottles of water."
 11941	
 11942	"I will follow you."
 11943	
 11944	"But," continued the Canadian, "if I am surprised, I will defend
 11945	myself; I will force them to kill me."
 11946	
 11947	"We will die together, friend Ned."
 11948	
 11949	I had made up my mind to all.  The Canadian left me.  I reached the
 11950	platform, on which I could with difficulty support myself against the
 11951	shock of the waves.  The sky was threatening; but, as land was in those
 11952	thick brown shadows, we must fly.  I returned to the saloon, fearing
 11953	and yet hoping to see Captain Nemo, wishing and yet not wishing to see
 11954	him.  What could I have said to him?  Could I hide the involuntary
 11955	horror with which he inspired me?  No. It was better that I should not
 11956	meet him face to face; better to forget him.  And yet----  How long
 11957	seemed that day, the last that I should pass in the Nautilus.  I
 11958	remained alone.  Ned Land and Conseil avoided speaking, for fear of
 11959	betraying themselves.  At six I dined, but I was not hungry; I forced
 11960	myself to eat in spite of my disgust, that I might not weaken myself.
 11961	At half-past six Ned Land came to my room, saying, "We shall not see
 11962	each other again before our departure.  At ten the moon will not be
 11963	risen.  We will profit by the darkness.  Come to the boat; Conseil and
 11964	I will wait for you."
 11965	
 11966	The Canadian went out without giving me time to answer.  Wishing to
 11967	verify the course of the Nautilus, I went to the saloon.  We were
 11968	running N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yards deep.  I
 11969	cast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of art
 11970	heaped up in this museum, upon the unrivalled collection destined to
 11971	perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it.  I wished
 11972	to fix an indelible impression of it in my mind.  I remained an hour
 11973	thus, bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling, and passing in
 11974	review those treasures shining under their glasses.  Then I returned to
 11975	my room.
 11976	
 11977	I dressed myself in strong sea clothing.  I collected my notes, placing
 11978	them carefully about me.  My heart beat loudly.  I could not check its
 11979	pulsations.  Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me
 11980	to Captain Nemo's eyes.  What was he doing at this moment?  I listened
 11981	at the door of his room.  I heard steps.  Captain Nemo was there.  He
 11982	had not gone to rest.  At every moment I expected to see him appear,
 11983	and ask me why I wished to fly.  I was constantly on the alert.  My
 11984	imagination magnified everything.  The impression became at last so
 11985	poignant that I asked myself if it would not be better to go to the
 11986	Captain's room, see him face to face, and brave him with look and
 11987	gesture.
 11988	
 11989	It was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately I resisted the desire,
 11990	and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation.  My nerves
 11991	were somewhat calmer, but in my excited brain I saw over again all my
 11992	existence on board the Nautilus; every incident, either happy or
 11993	unfortunate, which had happened since my disappearance from the Abraham
 11994	Lincoln--the submarine hunt, the Torres Straits, the savages of Papua,
 11995	the running ashore, the coral cemetery, the passage of Suez, the Island
 11996	of Santorin, the Cretan diver, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the iceberg, the
 11997	South Pole, the imprisonment in the ice, the fight among the poulps,
 11998	the storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and the horrible scene of
 11999	the vessel sunk with all her crew.  All these events passed before my
 12000	eyes like scenes in a drama.  Then Captain Nemo seemed to grow
 12001	enormously, his features to assume superhuman proportions.  He was no
 12002	longer my equal, but a man of the waters, the genie of the sea.
 12003	
 12004	It was then half-past nine.  I held my head between my hands to keep it
 12005	from bursting.  I closed my eyes; I would not think any longer.  There
 12006	was another half-hour to wait, another half-hour of a nightmare, which
 12007	might drive me mad.
 12008	
 12009	At that moment I heard the distant strains of the organ, a sad harmony
 12010	to an undefinable chant, the wail of a soul longing to break these
 12011	earthly bonds.  I listened with every sense, scarcely breathing;
 12012	plunged, like Captain Nemo, in that musical ecstasy, which was drawing
 12013	him in spirit to the end of life.
 12014	
 12015	Then a sudden thought terrified me.  Captain Nemo had left his room.
 12016	He was in the saloon, which I must cross to fly.  There I should meet
 12017	him for the last time.  He would see me, perhaps speak to me.  A
 12018	gesture of his might destroy me, a single word chain me on board.
 12019	
 12020	But ten was about to strike.  The moment had come for me to leave my
 12021	room, and join my companions.
 12022	
 12023	I must not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo himself should rise before
 12024	me.  I opened my door carefully; and even then, as it turned on its
 12025	hinges, it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise.  Perhaps it only
 12026	existed in my own imagination.
 12027	
 12028	I crept along the dark stairs of the Nautilus, stopping at each step to
 12029	check the beating of my heart.  I reached the door of the saloon, and
 12030	opened it gently.  It was plunged in profound darkness.  The strains of
 12031	the organ sounded faintly.  Captain Nemo was there.  He did not see me.
 12032	In the full light I do not think he would have noticed me, so entirely
 12033	was he absorbed in the ecstasy.
 12034	
 12035	I crept along the carpet, avoiding the slightest sound which might
 12036	betray my presence.  I was at least five minutes reaching the door, at
 12037	the opposite side, opening into the library.
 12038	
 12039	I was going to open it, when a sigh from Captain Nemo nailed me to the
 12040	spot.  I knew that he was rising.  I could even see him, for the light
 12041	from the library came through to the saloon.  He came towards me
 12042	silently, with his arms crossed, gliding like a spectre rather than
 12043	walking.  His breast was swelling with sobs; and I heard him murmur
 12044	these words (the last which ever struck my ear):
 12045	
 12046	"Almighty God! enough! enough!"
 12047	
 12048	Was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man's
 12049	conscience?
 12050	
 12051	In desperation, I rushed through the library, mounted the central
 12052	staircase, and, following the upper flight, reached the boat.  I crept
 12053	through the opening, which had already admitted my two companions.
 12054	
 12055	"Let us go! let us go!"  I exclaimed.
 12056	
 12057	"Directly!" replied the Canadian.
 12058	
 12059	The orifice in the plates of the Nautilus was first closed, and
 12060	fastened down by means of a false key, with which Ned Land had provided
 12061	himself; the opening in the boat was also closed.  The Canadian began
 12062	to loosen the bolts which still held us to the submarine boat.
 12063	
 12064	Suddenly a noise was heard.  Voices were answering each other loudly.
 12065	What was the matter?  Had they discovered our flight?  I felt Ned Land
 12066	slipping a dagger into my hand.
 12067	
 12068	"Yes," I murmured, "we know how to die!"
 12069	
 12070	The Canadian had stopped in his work.  But one word many times
 12071	repeated, a dreadful word, revealed the cause of the agitation
 12072	spreading on board the Nautilus.  It was not we the crew were looking
 12073	after!
 12074	
 12075	"The maelstrom! the maelstrom!"  Could a more dreadful word in a more
 12076	dreadful situation have sounded in our ears!  We were then upon the
 12077	dangerous coast of Norway.  Was the Nautilus being drawn into this gulf
 12078	at the moment our boat was going to leave its sides?  We knew that at
 12079	the tide the pent-up waters between the islands of Ferroe and Loffoden
 12080	rush with irresistible violence, forming a whirlpool from which no
 12081	vessel ever escapes.  From every point of the horizon enormous waves
 12082	were meeting, forming a gulf justly called the "Navel of the Ocean,"
 12083	whose power of attraction extends to a distance of twelve miles.
 12084	There, not only vessels, but whales are sacrificed, as well as white
 12085	bears from the northern regions.
 12086	
 12087	It is thither that the Nautilus, voluntarily or involuntarily, had been
 12088	run by the Captain.
 12089	
 12090	It was describing a spiral, the circumference of which was lessening by
 12091	degrees, and the boat, which was still fastened to its side, was
 12092	carried along with giddy speed.  I felt that sickly giddiness which
 12093	arises from long-continued whirling round.
 12094	
 12095	We were in dread.  Our horror was at its height, circulation had
 12096	stopped, all nervous influence was annihilated, and we were covered
 12097	with cold sweat, like a sweat of agony!  And what noise around our
 12098	frail bark!  What roarings repeated by the echo miles away!  What an
 12099	uproar was that of the waters broken on the sharp rocks at the bottom,
 12100	where the hardest bodies are crushed, and trees worn away, "with all
 12101	the fur rubbed off," according to the Norwegian phrase!
 12102	
 12103	What a situation to be in!  We rocked frightfully.  The Nautilus
 12104	defended itself like a human being.  Its steel muscles cracked.
 12105	Sometimes it seemed to stand upright, and we with it!
 12106	
 12107	"We must hold on," said Ned, "and look after the bolts.  We may still
 12108	be saved if we stick to the Nautilus."
 12109	
 12110	He had not finished the words, when we heard a crashing noise, the
 12111	bolts gave way, and the boat, torn from its groove, was hurled like a
 12112	stone from a sling into the midst of the whirlpool.
 12113	
 12114	My head struck on a piece of iron, and with the violent shock I lost
 12115	all consciousness.

 12119	CHAPTER XXIII
 12120	
 12121	CONCLUSION
 12122	
 12123	Thus ends the voyage under the seas.  What passed during that
 12124	night--how the boat escaped from the eddies of the maelstrom--how Ned
 12125	Land, Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.
 12126	
 12127	But when I returned to consciousness, I was lying in a fisherman's hut,
 12128	on the Loffoden Isles.  My two companions, safe and sound, were near me
 12129	holding my hands.  We embraced each other heartily.
 12130	
 12131	At that moment we could not think of returning to France.  The means of
 12132	communication between the north of Norway and the south are rare.  And
 12133	I am therefore obliged to wait for the steamboat running monthly from
 12134	Cape North.
 12135	
 12136	And, among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, I revise
 12137	my record of these adventures once more.  Not a fact has been omitted,
 12138	not a detail exaggerated.  It is a faithful narrative of this
 12139	incredible expedition in an element inaccessible to man, but to which
 12140	Progress will one day open a road.
 12141	
 12142	Shall I be believed?  I do not know.  And it matters little, after all.
 12143	What I now affirm is, that I have a right to speak of these seas, under
 12144	which, in less than ten months, I have crossed 20,000 leagues in that
 12145	submarine tour of the world, which has revealed so many wonders.
 12146	
 12147	But what has become of the Nautilus?  Did it resist the pressure of the
 12148	maelstrom?  Does Captain Nemo still live?  And does he still follow
 12149	under the ocean those frightful retaliations?  Or, did he stop after
 12150	the last hecatomb?
 12151	
 12152	Will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the
 12153	history of his life?  Shall I ever know the name of this man?  Will the
 12154	missing vessel tell us by its nationality that of Captain Nemo?
 12155	
 12156	I hope so.  And I also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the
 12157	sea at its most terrible gulf, and that the Nautilus has survived where
 12158	so many other vessels have been lost!  If it be so--if Captain Nemo
 12159	still inhabits the ocean, his adopted country, may hatred be appeased
 12160	in that savage heart!  May the contemplation of so many wonders
 12161	extinguish for ever the spirit of vengeance!  May the judge disappear,
 12162	and the philosopher continue the peaceful exploration of the sea!  If
 12163	his destiny be strange, it is also sublime.  Have I not understood it
 12164	myself?  Have I not lived ten months of this unnatural life?  And to
 12165	the question asked by Ecclesiastes three thousand years ago, "That
 12166	which is far off and exceeding deep, who can find it out?" two men
 12167	alone of all now living have the right to give an answer----
 12168	
 12169	CAPTAIN NEMO AND MYSELF.

 12213	THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 12214	PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
 12215	
 12216	To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 12217	distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 12218	(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 12219	Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 12220	Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 12221	https://gutenberg.org/license).

 12223	
 12224	Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 12225	electronic works
 12226	
 12227	1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 12228	electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 12229	and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 12230	(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 12231	the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 12232	all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 12233	If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 12234	Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 12235	terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 12236	entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
 12237	
 12238	1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 12239	used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 12240	agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 12241	things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 12242	even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 12243	paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 12244	Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 12245	and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 12246	works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
 12247	
 12248	1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 12249	or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 12250	Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 12251	collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 12252	individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 12253	located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 12254	copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 12255	works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 12256	are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 12257	Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 12258	freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 12259	this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 12260	the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 12261	keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 12262	Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
 12263	
 12264	1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 12265	what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 12266	a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 12267	the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 12268	before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 12269	creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 12270	Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 12271	the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 12272	States.
 12273	
 12274	1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
 12275	
 12276	1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 12277	access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

 12279	phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 12280	Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 12281	copied or distributed:
 12282	
 12283	This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 12284	almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 12285	re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 12286	with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org
 12287	
 12288	1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 12289	from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 12290	posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 12291	and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 12292	or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 12293	with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 12294	work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 12295	through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 12296	Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 12297	1.E.9.
 12298	
 12299	1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 12300	with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 12301	must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 12302	terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 12303	to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 12304	permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
 12305	
 12306	1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 12307	License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 12308	work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
 12309	
 12310	1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 12311	electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 12312	prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 12313	active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 12314	Gutenberg-tm License.
 12315	
 12316	1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 12317	compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 12318	word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 12319	distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 12320	"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 12321	posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
 12322	you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 12323	copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 12324	request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 12325	form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 12326	License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
 12327	
 12328	1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 12329	performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 12330	unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
 12331	
 12332	1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 12333	access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 12334	that
 12335	
 12336	- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
 12337	     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
 12338	     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
 12339	     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
 12340	     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
 12341	     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
 12342	     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
 12343	     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
 12344	     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
 12345	     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
 12346	     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
 12347	     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
 12348	
 12349	- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
 12350	     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
 12351	     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 12352	     License.  You must require such a user to return or
 12353	     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
 12354	     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
 12355	     Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 12356	
 12357	- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
 12358	     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
 12359	     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
 12360	     of receipt of the work.
 12361	
 12362	- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
 12363	     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
 12364	
 12365	1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 12366	electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 12367	forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 12368	both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 12369	Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 12370	Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
 12371	
 12372	1.F.
 12373	
 12374	1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 12375	effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 12376	public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 12377	collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 12378	works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 12379	"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 12380	corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 12381	property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 12382	computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 12383	your equipment.
 12384	
 12385	1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 12386	of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 12387	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

 12389	Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 12390	liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 12391	fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 12392	LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 12393	PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 12394	TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 12395	LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 12396	INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 12397	DAMAGE.
 12398	
 12399	1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 12400	defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 12401	receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 12402	written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 12403	received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 12404	your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 12405	the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 12406	refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 12407	providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 12408	receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 12409	is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 12410	opportunities to fix the problem.
 12411	
 12412	1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 12413	in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 12414	WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 12415	WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
 12416	
 12417	1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 12418	warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 12419	If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 12420	law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 12421	interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 12422	the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 12423	provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
 12424	
 12425	1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 12426	trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 12427	providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 12428	with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 12429	promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 12430	harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 12431	that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 12432	or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 12433	work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 12434	Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
 12435	
 12436	
 12437	Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
 12438	
 12439	Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 12440	electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 12441	including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 12442	because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 12443	people in all walks of life.
 12444	
 12445	Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 12446	assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 12447	goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 12448	remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 12449	Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 12450	and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 12451	To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 12452	and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 12453	and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

 12482	Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 12483	Literary Archive Foundation
 12484	
 12485	Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 12486	spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 12487	increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 12488	freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 12489	array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 12490	($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 12491	status with the IRS.
 12492	
 12493	The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 12494	charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 12495	States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 12496	considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 12497	with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 12498	where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 12499	SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 12500	particular state visit https://pglaf.org
 12501	
 12502	While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 12503	have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 12504	against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 12505	approach us with offers to donate.
 12506

 12508	any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

 12518	works.
 12519	
 12520	Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 12521	concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 12522	with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 12523	Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
 12524	
 12525	
 12526	Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 12527	editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 12528	unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 12529	keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
